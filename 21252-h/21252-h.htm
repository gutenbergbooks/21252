    <h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>
    <p><span class="smcap">When</span> I first entered on the business of Distilling, I
    was totally unacquainted with it. I was even so ignorant of the process, as not to
    know that fermentation was necessary, in producing spirits from grain. I had no idea
    that fire being put under a still, which, when hot enough, would raise a vapour; or
    that vapour when raised, could be condensed by a worm or tube passing through water
    into a liquid state. In short, my impressions were, that chop-rye mixed with water in
    a hogshead, and let stand for two or three days; and then put into a still, and fire
    being put under her, would produce the spirit by boiling up into the worm, and to
    pass through the water in order to cool it, and render it palatable for immediate
    use&mdash;and was certain the whole art and mystery could be learned in two or three
    weeks, or months at farthest, as I had frequently met with persons who professed a
    knowledge of the business, which they had acquired in two or three months, and tho'
    those men were esteemed distillers, and in possession of all the necessary art, in
    this very abstruse science; I soon found them to be ignorant blockheads, without
    natural genius, and often, without principle.</p>
    <p>Thus benighted, and with only the above light and knowledge, I entered into the
    dark, mysterious and abstruse science of distilling, a business professed to be
    perfectly understood by many, but in fact not sufficiently understood by any. For it
    presents a field for the learned, and man of science, for contemplation&mdash;that by
    a judicious and systematic appropriation and exercise of certain elements, valuable
    and salutary spirits and beverages may be produced in great perfection, and at a
    small expense, and little inconvenience, on almost every farm in our country.</p>
    <p>The professed chymist, and profound theorist may smile at my ideas, but should any
    one of them ever venture to soil a finger in the practical part of distilling, I
    venture to say, he would find more difficulty in producing good yeast, than in the
    process of creating oxygen or hydrogen gas. Scientific men generally look down on us,
    and that is principally owing to the circumstance of so many knaves, blockheads and
    conceited characters being engaged in the business.&mdash;If then, the subject could
    be improved, I fancy our country would yield all the necessary liquors, and in a
    state of perfection, to gratify the opulent, and please the epicure.</p>
    <p>I had no difficulty in finding out a reputed great distiller, whose directions I
    followed in procuring every necessary ingredient and material for distilling, &amp;c.
    He was industrious and attentive, and produced tolerable yield, but I soon found the
    quantity of the runs to vary, and the yield scarcely two days alike. I enquired into
    the cause, of him, but his answers were, he could not tell; I also enquired of other
    distillers, and could procure no more satisfactory answer&mdash;some attributed it to
    the water, others to witchcraft, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
    <p>I found them all ignorant&mdash;I was equally so, and wandered in the dark; but
    having commenced the business, I determined to have light on the subject; I thought
    there must be books containing instructions, but to my surprise, after a diligent
    search of all the book-stores and catalogues in Pennsylvania, I found there was no
    American work extant, treating on this science&mdash;and those of foreign production,
    so at variance with our habits, customs, and mode of economy, that I was compelled to
    abandon all hope of scientific or systematic aid, and move on under the instructions
    of those distillers of our neighborhood, who were little better informed than myself,
    but who cheerfully informed me of their experiments, and the results, and freely
    communicated their opinions and obligingly gave me their receipts. In the course of
    my progress, I purchased many receipts, and hesitated not to procure information of
    all who appeared to possess it, and sometimes at a heavy expense, and duly noted down
    all such discoveries and communications&mdash;made my experiments from time to time,
    and in various seasons, carefully noting down the results. Having made the business
    my constant and only study, carefully attending to the important branch of making
    yeast, and studying the cause and progress of fermentation, proceeding with numerous
    experiments, and always studying to discover the cause of every failure, or change,
    or difference in the yield. I could, after four years attention, tell the cause of
    such change, whether in the water, yeast, fermentation, quality of the grain,
    chopping the grain, or in mashing, and carefully corrected it immediately. By a thus
    close and indefatigable attention, I brought it to a system, in my mind, and to a
    degree of perfection, that I am convinced nothing but a long series of practice could
    have effected.</p>
    <p>From my record of most improved experiments, I cheerfully gave receipts to those
    who applied, and after their adoption obtaining some celebrity, I found applications
    so numerous, as to be troublesome, and to be impossible for me to furnish the demands
    gratis, of consequence, I was compelled to furnish to some, and refuse others; a
    conduct so pregnant with partiality, and a degree of illiberality naturally gave rise
    to murmurs.</p>
    <p>My friends strongly recommended a publication of them, the plan requiring the
    exercise of talents, order and method, with which I presumed myself not sufficiently
    versed, I for sometime obstinately refused, but at length and after reiterated
    solicitation, I consented to enter on the talk, under a flattering hope of affording
    useful information to those of my country engaged in the distillation of spirits from
    the growth of our native soil, which together with the following reasons, I offer as
    the only apology.</p>
    <p><b>1st</b>. I observed many distillers making fortunes, whilst others exercising
    an equal share of industry, and of equal merit were sinking money, owing to a want of
    knowledge in the business.</p>
    <p><b>2d</b>. In taverns I often observed foreign liquors drank in preference to
    those of domestic manufacture, though really of bad quality, possessing pernicious
    properties acquired from ingredients used by those in our commercial towns, who brew
    and compose brandies, spirits, and wines, often from materials most injurious to
    health, and this owing to so much bad liquor being made in our country, from which
    the reputation of domestic spirit has sunk. Whilst, in fact, we can make domestic
    spirits of various materials, which with a little management and age, will be
    superior to any of foreign produce.</p>
    <p><b>3d</b>. By making gin, &amp;c. as good if not better, we might in a few years,
    meet those foreign merchants in their own markets, and undersell them; which we
    certainly could do, by making our liquors good, and giving them the same age. The
    transportation would of consequence improve them in an equal degree, for the only
    advantage their liquors of the same age have over our good liquors, is the mildness
    acquired by the friction in the warm hold of the ship in crossing the ocean.</p>
    <p>And moreover as liquors will be drank by people of all standings in society, I
    flattered myself I could improve our liquors, render them more wholesome to those
    whose unhappy habits compel a too free use of ardent spirits, and whose constitutions
    may have been doubly injured from the pernicious qualities of such as they were
    compelled to use. For there are in all societies and of both sexes, who will drink
    and use those beverages to excess, even when there exists a moral certainty, that
    they will sustain injury from such indulgence, and as an evidence of my hypothesis, I
    offer the free use of coffee, tea, &amp;c. so universally introduced at the tables of
    people of every grade.</p>
    <p>The wise Disposer of worlds, very happily for mankind, permits the exhibition of
    genius, mind and talents, from the peasant and lower order, as well as from the
    monarch, the lord, and the opulent. To Europe they of course are not
    confined&mdash;Genius has already figured in our hemisphere&mdash;The arts and
    sciences are becoming familiar, they rise spontaneously from our native soil, and bid
    fair to vie with, if not out-shine accomplished Europe. In possession, then, of all
    the necessary materials, ingredients and requisites, I would ask why we cannot afford
    ardent spirits and wines equal to those imported; and thus raise our character to a
    standing with other countries, and retain those millions of dollars at home, which
    are yearly shipped abroad for those foreign liquors, so common, so universally in
    use, and much of which so adulterated, as to be followed, when freely used, with
    unhappy consequences. Would men of capital and science, turn their attention to
    distillations, from the produce of our own country, preserve the liquor until age and
    management would render it equal, if not superior to any imported; is it not probable
    that it would become an article of export, and most sensibly benefit our country at
    large.</p>
    <p>Considerations such as those have combined to determine a publication of my work;
    fully apprised of the scoffs of pedants, kicks, bites and bruises of
    critics&mdash;but I hope they will find latitude for the exercise of a share of
    compassion, when I inform them candidly, that a mill and distillery, or still house,
    were substituted for, and the only college and academy in which I ever studied, and
    those studies were broken, and during the exercise of my business, as a miller and
    distiller.</p>
    <p>That it contains errors in the diction and perspicuity, I will readily
    confess&mdash;but that it is in substance true, and contains much useful information,
    I must declare as an indisputable fact. And though the road I travelled was a new
    one, without compass, chart, or even star to steer by, not even a book to assist me
    in thinking, or cheer me in my gloomy passage&mdash;seeking from those springs of
    nature, and inherent endowments for consolatory aid&mdash;pressing on a frequently
    exhausted mind, for resources and funds, to accomplish the objects of my
    pursuits&mdash;not denying but that I met many of my fellow-beings, who cheerfully
    aided me with all the information in their power, and to whom I now present my
    thanks&mdash;I must acknowledge, I think my labors and exertions will prove useful to
    those of less experience than mine, in which event I shall feel a more ample
    remuneration for my exertions, than the price asked for one of those volumes.</p>
    <p>Could I have witnessed the publication of a similar work by a man of science and
    education, mine should never have appeared. But it would seem the learned and
    scientific have never considered a work of the kind as meriting their attention; a
    circumstance deeply to be regretted, as a finer colouring to a work of the same
    properties and value often procures celebrity, demand and currency. My object is to
    be useful, my style plain, and only laboured to be rendered easy to be understood,
    and convey the necessary instruction to those who may honor this work with a perusal,
    or resort to it for information, and that it may be useful to my countrymen, is the
    sincere wish of</p>

    <h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
    <p>It is not more than twenty years since whiskey was first offered for sale in the
    seaport towns in large quantities; and then, owing to its badness, at a very low
    price. Since that period it has been gaining ground yearly, and at this time, it is
    the second great article of commerce, in the states of Pennsylvania and Maryland.</p>
    <p>In the interior of these states, it has nearly excluded the use of foreign
    distilled spirits, and I fancy might be made so perfectly pure and nice, as to
    ultimately supersede the use of any other throughout the United States.</p>
    <p>To assist in effecting this, the greatest attention should be paid to cleanliness,
    which in a distillery is absolutely necessary, the want of which admits of no excuse,
    where water is had without price.</p>
    <p>If a distiller does not by a most industrious well-timed care and attention,
    preserve every utensil perfectly sweet and clean, he may expect, notwithstanding he
    has well attended to the other branches, but indifferent whiskey and not much of
    it.</p>
    <p>If, for instance, every article, or only one article in the composition of yeast
    be sour or dirty, that one article will most assuredly injure the whole; which being
    put into a hogshead of mashed grain, soon imparts its acidity or filth to the whole
    mass, and of course will reduce the quantity and quality of the spirit yielded from
    that hogshead. Cleanliness in every matter and thing, in and about a distillery
    becomes an indispensable requisite, without a strict observance of which the
    undertaker will find the establishment unproductive and injurious to his interest.
    Purity cannot exist without cleanliness. Cleanliness in the human system will destroy
    an obstinate itch, of consequence, it is the active handmaid of health and comfort,
    and without which, decency does not exist.</p>
    <p>Care is another important and necessary consideration, and a basis necessary, on
    which to erect a distillery, in order to ensure it productive of wealth and
    reputation. Care and industry will ensure cleanliness; an eye of care must be
    extended to everything, that nothing be lost, that every thing be in its proper place
    and order, that every thing be done in due time; the business must be well timed, and
    time well economised, as it ranks in this, as in every other business very high. Let
    a judicious attention be paid to care, cleanliness, and industry, and when united
    with a competent knowledge of the different branches of the distilling business, the
    character of a compleat practical distiller is perfect.</p>
    <p>With such a distiller, and a complete still-house, furnished with every necessary
    utensil for carrying on the business&mdash;it cannot fail to prove a very productive
    establishment, and present to the world, from the materials of our own farms, a
    spirit as wholesome, and well flavored and as healthy as any spirit
    whatever&mdash;the produce or yield of any country, provided it be permitted to
    acquire the same age.</p>
    <p>What a grand and great idea strikes the thinking scientific mind, on entering a
    complete and clean distillery, with an intelligent cleanly distiller, performing his
    duty in it.</p>
    <p>To see the four elements, each combining to produce (with the assistance of man)
    an article of commerce and luxury, and at the same time, a necessary beverage to man.
    The earth producing the grain, hops and utensils, which a combination of fire and
    water reduces into a liquid by fermentation, and when placed in the still to see air
    engaging fire to assist her in reducing the liquid that fire and water had produced,
    into a vapour, or air, and afterwards to see fire abandoning air, and assisting water
    to reduce it into a liquid by means of the condensing tubes, and then to consider the
    number of hands employed in keeping the distillery a going, will present one other
    patriotic idea. The farmer with all his domestics and people, engaged in the
    cultivation of the rye, corn, &amp;c. The wood choppers&mdash;the haling&mdash;the
    coopers engaged in making casks&mdash;the hands engaged in feeding cattle and the
    pork&mdash;haling, barrelling and selling the whiskey, spirits, pork, &amp;c. The
    produce of the distillery, presenting subject for commerce, and employ for the
    merchant, mechanic and mariner&mdash;and all from our own farms.</p>
    <p>After seeing the distillery afford employment for so many hands, bread to their
    families, and yielding the means of an extensive revenue and increase of
    commerce&mdash;with a flattering prospect of completely annihilating the use of
    foreign liquors in our country, and thereby saving the expenditure of millions of
    dollars; and ultimately rendering our liquors an article of export and source of
    wealth&mdash;I presume every mind will be struck with the propriety of encouraging a
    branch of business so promising in wealth and comfort.</p>
    <p>The following receipts are intended to convey all the instruction necessary in the
    science of distilling, and producing from the growth of our own farms, the best
    spirits of every description, and such as I flatter myself will supersede the use of
    all imported liquors, and thereby fulfil the views and wishes of</p>

    <h3><i>Observations on Yeast.</i></h3>
    <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
    <p>That yeast is the main spring in distilling, is acknowledged by all distillers,
    tho' but few if them understand it, either in its nature or operation; tho' many
    pretend a knowledge of the grand subject of fermentation, and affect to understand
    the best mode of making stock yeast, and to know a secret mode unknown to all
    others&mdash;when it is my belief they know very little about it; but, by holding out
    the idea of adding some drug, not to be procured at every house, which has a hard
    name, and that is little known to people of common capacities: Such as Dragons blood,
    &amp;c. frequently retailing their secret, as the best possible mode of making stock
    yeast, at ten, twenty, and in some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26"
    id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span> instances one hundred dollars.</p>
    <p>Confessing it a subject, abstruse, and a science little understood in
    Pennsylvania, and notwithstanding the numerous experiments I have made with care and
    close observation, yet from a consciousness of not understanding it, <i>too well</i>,
    I have in several instances purchased receipts, and made faithful experiments; but
    have never yet met the man of science, theory, or practice, whose mode of making
    stock yeast, yielded a better preparation for promoting fermentation, than the simple
    mode pursued by myself for some years, and which I have uniformly found to be the
    best and most productive.</p>
    <p>In making yeast, all drugs and witchcraft are unnecessary&mdash;Cleanliness, in
    preserving the vessels perfectly sweet, good malt, and hops, and an industrious
    distiller, capable of observation, and attention to the following receipt, which will
    be assuredly found to contain the essence and spirit of the ways and art of making
    that composition, a knowledge of which I have acquired, by
    purchases&mdash;consultations with the most eminent brewers, bakers, and distillers
    in this commonwealth, and above all, from a long practice and experience, proving its
    utility and superior merits to my most perfect satisfaction; and which I with<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span> pleasure offer to
    my fellow-citizens, as meriting a preference&mdash;notwithstanding the proud and
    scientific chymist, and the flowery declarations or treatises of the profound
    theorist, may disapprove this simple mode, and offer those which they presume to be
    better, tho' they never soiled a finger in making a practical experiment, or perhaps
    witnessed a process of any description.</p>

    <h3><i>Receipt for Stock Yeast</i>.</h3>
    <h4><i>For a stock yeast vessel of two gallons, the size best adapted for that
    purpose</i>.</h4>
    <p>Take one gallon good barley malt, (be sure it be of good quality) put it into a
    clean, well scalded vessel, (which take care shall be perfectly sweet) pour thereon
    four gallons scalding water, (be careful your water be clean) stir the malt and water
    with a well scalded stick, until thoroughly mixed<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span> together, then cover the vessel close
    with a clean cloth, for half an hour; then uncover it and set it in some convenient
    place to settle, after three or four hours, or when you are sure the sediment of the
    malt is settled to the bottom, then pour off the top, or thin part that remains on
    the top, into a clean well scoured iron pot, (be careful not to disturb the thick
    sediment in the bottom, and that none of it goes into the pot); then add four ounces
    good hops, and cover the pot close with a clean scalded iron cover, and set it on a
    hot fire of coals to boil&mdash;boil it down one third, or rather more, then strain
    all that is in the pot through a thin hair sieve, (that is perfectly clean) into a
    clean well scalded earthen crock that is glazed&mdash;then stir into it, with a clean
    stirring stick, as much superfine flour as will make it about half thick, that is
    neither thick nor thin, but between the two, stirring it effectually until there be
    no lumps left in it. If lumps are left, you will readily perceive that the heart or
    inside of those lumps will not be scalded, and of course, when the yeast begins to
    work, those lumps will sour very soon, and of course sour the yeast&mdash;stir it
    then till those lumps are all broken, and mixed up, then cover it close for half an
    hour, to let the flour stirred therein, be properly scalded, after which uncover and
    stir it frequently until it is a little colder than<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span> milk warm, (to be ascertained by
    holding your finger therein for ten minutes, but beware your finger is clean) then
    add half a pint of genuine good yeast,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> (be certain it is good, for you had
    better use none, than bad yeast) and stir it effectually, until you are sure the
    yeast is perfectly incorporated with the ingredients in the pot&mdash;after which
    cover it, and set it in a moderately cool place in summer, until you perceive it
    begin to work, or ferment&mdash;then be careful to stir it two or three times at
    intervals of half an hour&mdash;then set it past to work&mdash;in the winter, place
    it in a moderately warm part of the still-house&mdash;and in summer, choose a spring
    house, almost up to the brim of the crock in water&mdash;avoiding extremes of heat or
    cold, which are equally prejudicial to the spirit of fermentation&mdash;of
    consequence, it should be placed in a moderately warm situation in the winter, and
    moderately cool in the summer.</p>
    <p>This yeast ought to be renewed every four or five days in the summer, and eight or
    ten days in the winter&mdash;but it is safer to renew it oftener, or at shorter
    intervals, than suffering it to stand longer. In twenty-four hours after it begins to
    work, it is fit for use.</p>
    <p>Between a pint and half a pint of the foregoing stock yeast, is sufficient to
    raise the yeast for the daily use of three hogsheads.</p>
    <hr style="width: 25%;" />
    <h4>ART. III.</h4>
    <p>The most proper vessel for preserving stock yeast is an earthen crock, that will
    hold three gallons at least, with a cover of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30"
    id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span> the same, well glazed&mdash;as it will contract no
    acid from the fermentation, and is easily scalded and sweetened. There ought to be
    two of the same size, that when one is in use, the other may be
    sweetening&mdash;which is effected by exposing them to frost or fire.</p>

    <h3><i>To know when Yeast is good or bad.</i></h3>
    <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>
    <p>When you perceive your yeast working, observe if it works quick, sharp and strong,
    and increasing in bulk nearly double what it was before it began to work, with a
    sweet sharp taste, and smell, with the appearance of a honey comb, with pores, and
    always changing place, with a bright lively colour, then you may pronounce your yeast
    good; on the contrary, if it is dead, or flat and blue looking, with a sour taste,
    and smell, (if any at all,) then you may pronounce it bad, and unfit for use, and of
    course must be renewed.</p>

    <h3><i>How to renew Yeast when sour.</i></h3>
    <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>
    <p>About two hours before you begin to make your beer, take one pint of the sour
    yeast, put it into a clean dish or vessel, and pour clean cold water over
    it&mdash;changing the water every fifteen minutes, until the acid be extracted, have
    it then in readiness to mix with the beer, which is to be prepared, in the following
    manner, viz. Take one pint malt, and scald it well in a clean vessel, with a gallon
    of boiling water, let it stand half an hour closely covered&mdash;then pour it into a
    pot with plenty of hops&mdash;then strain it into a well scalded earthen jug, when
    milk warm&mdash;add then a small quantity of the yeast, (sweetened as directed in the
    first part of this receipt,) with two or three table spoon fulls of molasses ... set
    it past for twenty four hours to ferment ... then pour off the top, or beer that is
    in the jug, leaving about a quart in the bottom ... then that which remains in the

    <p>The method of procuring and keeping stock yeast, by the generality of distillers,
    merits in the mind of the author of this work, most decided disapprobation. They
    generally procure yeast once a week, or month, from brewers, and if not convenient to
    be had in this way, they often use such as is used by country women, for baking
    bread, without paying any regard to the quality, or whether sour; with such, tho'
    generally bad, they proceed to make their daily yeast, and often continue the use of
    it, until the grain will no longer yield a gallon of whiskey to the bushel, and so
    often proceed in this miserable and indolent mode of procuring and renewing yeast, to
    the great prejudice of their own, and employer's interest ... attributing the small
    yield of liquor to the badness of the grain ... the manner in which it is chopped, or
    some other equally false cause. Then to the idle and careless habits of distillers,
    must be attributed any yield short of three gallons to the bushel of rye.... To
    ensure this quantity at least from the bushel, the author discovers the anxiety
    expressed, and the care recommended in the foregoing pages, on the subject of
    preserving and keeping good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg
    34]</a></span> yeast, and recommends the following as the best mode of preparing.</p>
    <hr style="width: 25%;" />
    <h4>ART. VII.</h4>
    <h3><i>Stock Yeast good for years.</i></h3>
    <p>When the weather is moderately warm in autumn or the spring, take of your best
    stock yeast that has fermented about twenty four hours, and stir it thick with the
    coarsest middlings of wheat flour, add small quantity of whiskey, in which,
    previously dissolve a little salt, when you have stirred the middlings with a stick,
    rub it between your hands until it becomes pretty dry, then spread it out thin, on a
    board to dry in the sun ... rubbing once or twice in the day between your hands until
    it is perfectly dry, which will be in three or four good days&mdash;taking it in at
    night before the dew falls&mdash;when it is properly dried, put it up in a paper and
    keep it in a dry airy place for use.</p>
    <p>Thus yeast will keep good, if free from moisture, for any length of time, and it
    is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span> the only
    effectual mode of preserving stock yeast pure and sweet ... when put up conformably
    to the foregoing instructions, the distiller may always rely on having it good, and
    depend on a good turn out of his grain, provided he manages the other parts of his
    distilling equally well.</p>
    <p>About two hours before you mean to use the dried yeast, the mode is to take two
    gills, place it in any convenient vessel, and pour thereon milk-warm water, stir and
    mix it well with the yeast, and in two or three hours good working yeast will be
    produced.</p>
    <p>In the spring every distiller ought to make as much as would serve 'till fall, and
    every fall as much as will serve thro' the winter, reckoning on the use of one pint
    per week, three gills being sufficient to start as much stock yeast as will serve a
    common distillery one week.</p>

    <h3><i>To make the best Yeast for daily use.</i></h3>
    <p>For three hogsheads take two handfuls of hops, put them into an iron pot, and pour
    thereon three gallons boiling water out of your boiler, set the pot on the fire
    closely covered half an hour, to extract the strength from the hops, then strain it
    into your yeast vessel, thicken it with chopped rye, from which the bran has been
    sifted ... stir it with a clean stick until the lumps are all well broken and mixed
    ... cover it close with a cloth for half an hour, adding at the time of putting in
    the chopped rye, one pint of good malt when the rye is sufficiently scalded, uncover
    and stir it well until it is milk-warm, then add one pint good stock yeast, stirring
    until you are sure it is well mixed with the new yeast. If your stock yeast is good,
    this method will serve you ... observing always, that your water and vessels are
    clean, and the ingredients of a good quality; as soon as you have cooled off and
    emptied your yeast vessel, scald and scour, and expose it to the night air to purify.
    Tin makes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span> the
    best yeast vessel for yeast made daily, in the above mode.</p>
    <p>In the course of my long practice in distilling I fully discovered that a nice
    attention to yeast is absolutely necessary, and altho' I have in the foregoing pages
    said a great deal on the subject, yet from the importance justly to be attached to
    this ingredient in distilling, and to shew more fully the advantages and
    disadvantages arising from the use of good and bad yeast, I submit the following
    statement for the consideration of my readers.</p>

    <p>Thus the owner or distiller frequently sustains in the distillation of his
    produce, a loss, equal and in proportion to the foregoing&mdash;from the use of
    indifferent yeast, and often without knowing to what cause to attribute it. This
    statement will shew more forcibly, than any other mode&mdash;and is made very
    moderate on the side of indifferent yeast, for with bad sour yeast the yield will be
    oftener under one gallon to the bushel than above one and an half&mdash;whereas with
    good yeast the yield will rarely be so low as three gallons to the bushel. It is
    therefore, I endeavor so strongly to persuade the distiller to pay every possible
    attention to the foregoing instructions, and the constant use of good yeast only, to
    the total rejection of all which may be of doubtful quality.</p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>

    <h3><i>Observations on Wood for Hogsheads.</i></h3>
    <p>The cheapest and easiest wrought wood is generally most used for making mashing
    tubs, or hogsheads, and very often for dispatch or from necessity, any wood that is
    most convenient is taken, as pine or chesnut; indeed I have seen poplar tubs in use
    for mashing, which is very wrong, as a distiller by not having his hogsheads of good
    wood, may lose perhaps the price of two sets of hogsheads in one season. For
    instance, a farmer is about to erect a distillery, and is convenient to a mountain,
    abounding in chesnut or pine, which from its softness and the ease with which it may
    be worked, its convenience for dispatch sake, is readily chosen for his mashing
    hogsheads.&mdash;To such selection of wood, I offer my most decided disapprobation,
    from my long expe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg
    40]</a></span>rience, I know that any kind of soft wood will not do in warm weather.
    Soft porus wood made up into mashing tubs when full of beer and under fermentation,
    will contract, receive or soak in so much acid, as to penetrate nearly thro' the
    stave, and sour the vessel to such a degree, in warm weather, that no scalding will
    take it out&mdash;nor can it be completely sweetened until filled with cold water for
    two or three days, and then scalded; I therefore strongly recommend the use of, as
    most proper</p>
    <h3><i>White Oak.</i></h3>
    <p>Disapproving of black, tho' next in order to white oak staves for all the vessels
    about the distillery ... as being the most durable of close texture, easily sweetened
    ... and hard to be penetrated by acids of any kind, tho' sometimes the best white oak
    hogsheads may sour, but two or three scaldings will render them perfectly sweet ...
    if white oak cannot be had, black oak being of the next best in quality may be used
    ... and again I enter my protest against pine, chesnut, poplar, and every kind of
    soft porus wood.</p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
    <p>If possible, or if at all convenient, have the vessels iron bound and painted, to
    prevent worms and the weather from injuring them, using one good wood hoop on the
    bottom to save the chine.</p>
    <hr style="width: 25%;" />
    <h4>ART. II.</h4>
    <h3><i>To sweeten Hogsheads by scalding.</i></h3>
    <p>When you turn your vessels out of doors (for it is esteemed slothful and a lazy
    mode to scald them in the still house,) you must wash them clean with your scrubbing
    brush, then put in sixteen or twenty gallons boiling water&mdash;cover it close for
    about twenty minutes, then scrub it out effectually with your scrubbing broom, then
    rinse your vessel well with a couple buckets clean cold water, and set them out to
    receive the air&mdash;this method will do in the winter, provided they are left out
    in the frost over night&mdash;but in summer, and especially during the months of July
    and August, this mode will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg
    42]</a></span> not do&mdash;it is during those extreme warm months in our latitude,
    that the vessels are liable to contract putrid particles, which may be corrected by
    the following mode of making</p>
    <h3><i>Hogsheads perfectly sweet.</i></h3>
    <p>Scald them twice, as above directed, then light a brimstone match, flick it on the
    ground, turn your hogshead down over it, let it stand until the match quits burning,
    this operation is necessary once a week&mdash;a method I have found effectual.</p>
    <hr style="width: 25%;" />
    <h4>ART. III.</h4>
    <h3><i>To sweeten Hogsheads by burning.</i></h3>
    <p>When you have scalded your hogsheads well, put into each, a large handful of oat
    or rye straw, set it on fire, and stir it till it is<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span> in a blaze, then turn the mouth of the
    hogshead down; the smoke will purify and sweeten the cask. This process should be
    repeated every other day, especially during summer&mdash;it will afford you good
    working casks, provided your yeast be good, and your hogsheads are well mashed.</p>
    <p>There ought always to be in a distillery more vessels than are necessary for
    immediate use, that they may alternately be exposed to the frost and air one night at
    least before brought into service, always bearing in mind that the utmost attention
    to cleanliness is necessary, in order to afford such yield from the grain, or fruit,
    as may be requisite to compensate for the expense and labor of extracting
    spirits&mdash;and moreover, that the exercise of the finest genius possessed by man
    is scarcely capable of taking from small grain, all the spirit it contains:.... good
    materials will not suffice ... the most marked attention is indispensably necessary
    to yeast; a mind capable of judging of fermentation in all its stages ... a close
    adherence to the manner of using the ingredients ... preparing them, and the use of
    sweet vessels, with great industry and a knowledge to apply it at the proper moment,
    are all necessary to enable the accomplishment of the desired end.</p><span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
    <p>Note ... In scalding your hogshead I would recommend the use of a shovel full of
    ashes, which will scald more sharply.</p>

    <h3><i>To Mash two thirds Rye and one third Corn in Summer.</i></h3>
    <p>This I have found to be the nicest process belonging to distilling&mdash;the small
    proportion of corn, and the large quantity of scalding water, together with the easy
    scalding of rye, and the difficulty of scalding corn, makes it no easy matter to
    exactly hit the scald of both; but as some distillers continue to practice it,
    (altho' not a good method in my mind, owing to the extreme nice attention necessary
    in performing it.) In the following receipt I offer the best mode within my
    knowledge, and which I deem the most beneficial, and in which I shew the process and
    mode pursued by other distillers.</p>
    <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>
    <p>Take four gallons cold water, put it into a hogshead, then stir half a bushel corn
    into it, let it stand uncovered thirty minutes, then add sixteen gallons boiling
    water, stir it well, cover it close for fifteen minutes, then put in your rye and
    malt and stir it until there be no lumps, then cover it and stir it at intervals
    until your still boils, then add, eight, twelve, or sixteen gallons boiling water, or
    such quantity as you find from experience, to answer best&mdash;(but with most water,
    twelve gallons will be found to answer) stirring it well every fifteen minutes until
    you perceive it is scalded enough, then uncover and stir it effectually until you
    cool off; keeping in mind always that the more effectually you stir it, the more
    whiskey will be yielded. This method I have found to answer best, however, I have
    known it to do very well, by soaking the corn in the first place, with two gallons
    warm, and two gallons cold water, instead of the four gallons of cold water,
    mentioned above&mdash;others put in the rye, when all the boiling water is in the
    hogshead, but I never found it to answer a good purpose, nor indeed did I ever find
    much profit in distilling rye and corn in this proportion.</p>

    <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
    <h3><i>To distill one half Rye and one half Corn.</i></h3>
    <p>This method of distilling equal quantities of rye and corn, is more in practice,
    and is much better than to distill unequal proportions, for reason you can scald your
    corn and rye to a certainty, and the produce is equal if not more, and better
    whiskey, than all rye. The indian corn is cheaper, and the seed is better than if all
    rye. I would recommend this, as the smallest quantity of corn to be mixed with rye
    for distillation, as being most productive, and profitable. The following receipt I
    have found to answer all waters&mdash;yet there may be places where the distiller
    cannot follow this receipt exactly, owing to hard or soft water, (as it is generally
    termed) or hard flint or soft floury corn, that will either scald too much or too
    little&mdash;but this the attentive distiller will soon determine by experience.</p>
    <p>Have your hogshead perfectly sweet, put into each, three gallons of cold and three
    of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span> boiling
    water, or more or less of each, as you find will answer best&mdash;then stir in your
    corn&mdash;fill up your boiler, bring it briskly to a boil&mdash;then put to each
    hogshead twelve gallons boiling water, giving each hogshead one hundred stirs, with
    your mashing stick, then cover close, fill up your boiler and keep a good fire under
    her, to produce a speedy boil; before you add the last water, put into each hogshead
    one pint of salt, and a shovel full of hot coals and ashes from under your still,
    stir the salt and coals well, to mix it with your corn, the coal will remove any bad
    smell which may be in the hogshead&mdash;Should you find on trial, that rye don't
    scald enough, by putting it in after your last water, you may in that case put in
    your rye before the last water&mdash;but this should be ascertained from several
    experiments. I have found it to answer best to put in the rye after all the water is
    in the hogshead, especially if you always bring the still briskly to a
    boil&mdash;then on your corn put twelve or sixteen gallons boiling water, (for the
    last water,) then if you have not already mashed in your rye, put it in with one
    gallon good malt to each hogshead, carefully stirring it immediately very briskly,
    for fear of the water loosing its heat, and until the lumps are all broken, which you
    will discover by looking at your mashing stick; lumps generally stick to it. When
    done stirring, co<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg
    51]</a></span>ver the hogshead close for half an hour, then stir it to ascertain
    whether your grain be sufficiently scalded, and when nearly scalded enough, uncover
    and stir steady until you have it cool enough to stop scalding; when you see it is
    scalded enough, and by stirring that the scalding is stopped, uncover your hogsheads,
    and stir them effectually, every fifteen minutes, until they are fit to cool
    off&mdash;remembering that sweet good yeast, clean sweet hogsheads, with this mode of
    mashing carefully, will produce you a good turn out of your grain. The quantity of
    corn and rye is generally two stroked half bushels of each, and one gallon malt.</p>
    <hr style="width: 25%;" />
    <h4>ART. V.</h4>
    <h3><i>To Mash one third Rye and two thirds Corn.</i></h3>
    <p>This I deem the most profitable mashing that a distiller can work, and if he can
    get completely in the way of working corn and rye in this proportion, he will find
    it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span> the easiest
    process of mashing. That corn has as much and as good whiskey as rye or any other
    grain, cannot be disputed, and the slop or pot ale is much superior to that of any
    other grain, for feeding or fattening either horned cattle or hogs&mdash;one gallon
    of corn pot ale being esteemed worth three of rye, and cattle will always eat it
    better&mdash;and moreover, corn is always from one to two shillings per bushel
    cheaper than rye, and in many places much plentier&mdash;so that by adopting this
    method and performing it well, the distiller will find at the close of the year, it
    has advantages over all other processes and mixtures of rye and corn, yielding more
    profit, and sustaining the flock better. Hogs fatted on this pot ale, will be found
    decidedly better than any fatted on the slops of any other kind of mashing.</p>
    <h3><i>Mash as follows.</i></h3>
    <p>Have sweet hogsheads, good yeast and clean water in your boiler; when the water is
    sharp, warm, or half boiling, put into every hogshead you mean to mash at the same
    time, six, eight or as many gallons of the half boiling water, as will completely wet
    one bushel corn meal&mdash;add then one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53"
    id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span> bushel chopped corn, stir it with your mashing stick
    till your corn is all wet; it is better to put in a less quantity of water first, and
    so add as you may find necessary, until completely wet (be careful in all mashings,
    that your mashing stick be clean), this is called soaking the corn. Then fill up your
    boiler, bring her quickly to a boil, when effectually boiling, put into every
    hogshead, twelve gallons boiling water, stirring it well after putting in each
    bucket, until the lumps are quite broken&mdash;cover the hogsheads close, after a
    complete stirring&mdash;fill up your boiler, bring her quickly to boil for the last
    mashing&mdash;stir the corn in the hogshead every fifteen minutes, till your last
    water is boiling&mdash;put into each hogshead one pint salt, and a shovel full of red
    hot coals, stirring it well&mdash;then put in each hogshead sixteen gallons of
    boiling water, stir it well&mdash;cover it close for twenty-five minutes&mdash;then
    put into each hogshead one half bushel rye meal, and one gallon good chopped malt,
    stirring it until the lumps are all broken, then cover it close, stir it every half
    hour, until you perceive it sufficiently scalded&mdash;then uncover it and stir it as
    often as your other business will permit, until ready to cool off.</p>
    <p>In this and every other mashing you must use sweet vessels only and good yeast,
    or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span> your labor
    will be in vain; and in all kinds of mashing you cannot stir too much.</p>
    <hr style="width: 25%;" />
    <h4>ART. VI.</h4>
    <h3><i>To Mash Corn.</i></h3>
    <p>This is an unprofitable and unproductive mode of mashing, but there may be some
    times when the distiller is out of rye, on account of the mill being stopped, bad
    roads, bad weather, or some other cause; and to avoid the necessity of feeding raw
    grain to the hogs or cattle, (presuming every distillery to be depended on for
    supplying a stock of some kind, and often as a great reliance for a large stock of
    cattle and hogs,) in cold weather I have found it answer very well, but in warm
    weather it will not do. Those who may be compelled then from the above causes, or led
    to it by fancy, may try the following method. To one hogshead, put twelve gallons
    boiling water, and one and an half bushels corn, stir it well, then when your water
    boils, add<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
    twelve gallons more, (boiling hot,) stir it well, and cover it close, until the still
    boils the third time, then put in each hogshead, one quart of salt, and sixteen

    <h3><i>To make four gallons from the bushel.</i></h3>
    <p>This is a method of mashing that I much approve of, and recommend to all whiskey
    distillers to try it&mdash;it is easy in process, and is very little more trouble
    than the common method, and may be done in every way of mashing, as well with corn or
    rye, as also a mixture of each, for eight<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56"
    id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span> months in the year; and for the other four is worth
    the trouble of following. I do not mean to say that the quantity of four gallons can
    be made at an average, in every distillery, with every sort of grain, and water, or
    during every vicissitude of weather, and by every distiller, but this far I will
    venture to say, that a still house that is kept in complete order, with good water,
    grain well chopped, good malt, hops, and above all good yeast; together with an apt,
    careful and industrious distiller, cannot fail to produce at an average for eight
    months in the year, three and three quarter gallons from the bushel at a moderate
    calculation. I have known it sometimes produce four and an half gallons to the
    bushel, for two or three days, and sometimes for as many weeks, when perhaps, the
    third or fourth day, or week, it would scarcely yield three gallons; a change we must
    account for, in a change of weather, the water or the neglect or ignorance of the
    distiller. For instance, we know that four gallons of whiskey is in the bushel of rye
    or corn&mdash;certain, that this quantity has been made from the bushel; then why not
    always? Because, is the answer, there is something wrong, sour yeast or hogsheads,
    neglect of duty in the distiller, change of grain, or change of weather&mdash;then of
    course it is the duty of the distiller to guard against all these causes as<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span> near as he can. The
    following method, if it does not produce in every distillery the quantity above
    mentioned, will certainly produce more whiskey from the bushel, than any other mode I
    have ever known pursued.</p>
    <p>Mash your grain in the method that you find will yield you most whiskey&mdash;the
    day before you intend mashing, have a clean hogshead set in a convenient part of the
    distillery; when your singling still is run off, take the head off and fill her up
    with clean water, let her stand half an hour, to let the thick part settle to the
    bottom, which it will do when settled, dip out with a gallon or pail, and fill the
    clean hogshead half full, let the hogshead stand until it cools a little, so that
    when you fill it up with cool water, it will be about milk-warm, then yeast it off
    with the yeast for making 4 gallons to the bushel, then cover it close, and let it
    work or ferment until the day following, when you are going to cool off; when the
    cold water is running into your hogshead of mashed stuff, take the one third of this
    hogshead to every hogshead, (the above being calculated for three hogsheads) to be
    mashed every day, stirring the hogsheads well before you yeast them off. This process
    is simple, and I flatter myself will be found worthy of the trouble.</p>

    there remains the heart of the grain on your mashing stick, like grains of timothy
    seed, then be assured that it is sufficiently scalded, if not too much, this hint

    <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
    <h3><i>Directions for cooling off.</i></h3>
    <p>Much observation is necessary to enable the distiller to cool off with
    judgment&mdash;which necessity is increased by the versatility of our climate, the
    seasons of the year, and the kinds of water used. These circumstances prevent a
    strict adherence to any particular or specific mode; I however submit a few
    observations for the guidance of distillers in this branch.&mdash;If in summer you go
    to cool off with cold spring water, then of course the mashed stuff in your hogsheads
    must be much warmer, than if you intended cooling off with creek or river water, both
    of which are generally near milk warm, which is the proper heat for cooling
    off&mdash;In summer a little cooler, and in winter a little warmer.</p>
    <p>It will be found that a hogshead of mashed grain will always get warmer, after it
    begins to work or ferment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg
    60]</a></span></p>
    <p>When the mashed stuff in your hogsheads is brought to a certain degree of heat, by
    stirring, which in summer will feel sharp warm, or so warm, that you can hardly bear
    your hand in it for any length of time, will do for common water, but for very cold
    or very warm water to cool off with, the stuff in the hogsheads must be left colder
    or warmer, as the distiller may think most expedient, or to best suit the cooling off
    water.</p>
    <p>When you think it is time to cool off, have a trough or conveyance to bring the
    water to your hogsheads ready&mdash;let the hogsheads be well stirred, then let the
    water run into them slowly, stirring them all the time the water is running in, until
    they are milk warm, then stop the water, and after stirring them perfectly, put in
    the yeast and stir it until completely incorporated with the mashed stuff, then cover
    your hogshead until it begins to ferment or work, then uncover it.<span

    <hr style="width: 25%;" />
    <h4>ART. X.</h4>
    <h3><i>To ascertain when Rye works well in the Hogshead.</i></h3>
    <p>When mashed rye begins to work or ferment in the hogsheads, either in a heavy,
    thick, or light bubbly top, both of which are unfavorable; when it rises in a thick
    heavy top, you may be sure there is something wrong, either in the grain, yeast, or
    cooling off. When the top (as called by distillers) appear, with bubbles about the
    size of a nutmeg, rising and falling alternately, with the top not too thick nor too
    thin, and with the appearance of waves, mixed with the grain in the hogshead, rising
    and falling in succession, and when you put your head over the steam, and it flying
    into your nose, will have a suffocating effect, or when it will instantly extinguish
    a candle when held over it, you may feel assured, it is working well.<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

    <h3><i>To prevent Hogsheads from working over.</i></h3>
    <p>If the stuff is cooled off too warm, or too much yeast is put in the hogsheads,
    they will work over, and of course lose a great deal of spirit, to prevent which,
    take tallow and rub round the chine of the hogsheads a little higher than they ought
    to work; it will generally prevent them from rising any higher, but if they will work
    over in spite of this remedy, then drop a little tallow into the stuff, it will
    immediately sink the stuff to a proper height.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63"

    <h3><i>Observations on the quality of Rye for distilling.</i></h3>
    <p>The best rye for distilling is that which is thoroughly ripe, before it is cut,
    and kept dry till threshed; if it has grown on high or hilly ground, it is therefore
    to be preferred, being then sounder and the grain fuller, than that produced on low
    level land&mdash;but very often the distiller has no choice, but must take that which
    is most convenient;&mdash;great care however ought to be observed in selecting sound
    rye, that has been kept dry, is clean and free from cockle, and<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span> all kind of dirt,
    advantages will result from fanning it, or running it through a windmill before it is
    chopped.</p>
    <h4>ART. II.</h4>
    <h3><i>Mode of chopping Rye and the proper size.</i></h3>
    <p>The mill stones ought to be burrs, and kept very sharp for chopping rye for
    distillation; and the miller ought to be careful not to draw more water on the wheel
    than just sufficient to do it well, and avoid feeding the stones plentifully; because
    in drawing a plentiful supply of water, the wheel will compel a too rapid movement of
    the stones, of course render it necessary they should be more abundantly fed, which
    causes part to be ground dead, or too fine, whilst part thereof will be too coarse,
    and not sufficiently broken, so that a difficulty arises in scalding&mdash;for in
    this state it will not scald equally, and of consequence, the<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span> fermentation cannot be so good or
    regular; and moreover as part of it will merely be flattened, a greater difficulty
    will arise in breaking the lumps, when you mash and stir your hogsheads. If burr
    stones are very sharp, I recommend the rye to be chopped very fine, but to guard
    against over-seeding, or pressing too much on them; but if the stones are not sharp,
    I would recommend the rye should be chopped about half fine. Distillers in general
    sustain a loss from having their rye chopped so coarse as I have observed it done in
    common.</p>

    <h4>ART. IV.</h4>
    <h3><i>Malt</i></h3>
    <p>Cannot be ground too coarse, provided it is done even&mdash;there ought to be no
    fine nor coarse grains in malt, but ground perfectly alike, and of the same grade. If
    ground too fine, it will be apt to be scalded too much in mashing. Malt does not
    require half the scalding necessary in rye. Let the distiller try the experiment of
    coarse and then of fine ground malt and judge for himself.</p>

    square, the walls to be composed of single brick, 3 feet high&mdash;lay the bottom
    with brick, cover it with a plaster of mortar, to prevent the floor from taking fire.
    Turn the funnel of the chimney into, and extend it to the centre of the kiln, cover
    the top, leaving vent holes at the sides for the heat to escape thro'&mdash;Place on
    the top of the kiln, sheet iron or tin punched full of small holes, too small to
    admit the passage of malt; lay the malt on the top of the tin, when ready for drying.
    Put coals from under the still furnace into the small furnace leading to the kiln,
    which will heat the kiln and dry the malt above, by adding to or diminishing the
    quantity of coals, the heat may be increased or decreased, as may be found necessary.

    <p>Buckwheat is an unprofitable grain for the distillers when distilled by itself,
    but when mixed with rye, it will yield nearly as much as rye; but I would by no means
    recommend the use of it when it can be avoided. Tho' sometimes necessity requires
    that a distiller should mash it for a day or two, when any thing is the matter, or
    that grain cannot be procured. In such event, the directions for distilling rye, or
    rye and corn may be followed, but it requires a much larger quantity of boiling water
    and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span> if
    distilled by itself; it is necessary some wheat bran be mixed with it to raise it to
    the top of the hogshead: but by no means use buckwheat meal in making yeast.</p>
    <h4>ART. V.</h4>
    <h3><i>Distilling of Potatoes.</i></h3>
    <p>This is a branch of distilling that I cannot too highly recommend to the attention
    of every American&mdash;nor can the cultivation of this valuable vegetable be carried
    to a too great extent, the value of which ought to be known to every planter and it
    some times has awakened my surprise that they are not more cultivated, as it is
    notorious that they will sustain, and be a tolerable food for every thing possessing
    life on this earth&mdash;and as they produce a brandy, if properly made, of fine
    flavour. I hope yet to see the day when it will take precedence of French brandy and
    West-India spirits, and thereby retain in our own country, the immense sums at
    present expended on those foreign liquors; which, tho' benefitted by the sea voyage,
    yet often reaches us in a most per<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79"
    id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>nicious state, and is frequently adulterated here.</p>
    <p>Could the American farmer be brought to raise a larger quantity of potatoes than
    necessary for his consumption at home, the price would be lowered, and the distiller
    might commence the distillation of them with greater propriety. That they contain a
    great deal and a very good spirit, I am certain, and moreover, after distillation
    will yield as great a quantity of good wholesome food for cattle or hogs, as rye or
    any other grain. If distillers could be brought to try the experiment of distilling
    ten or twelve bushels annually, I venture to predict that it would soon become a
    source of profit to themselves, encouragement to the farmer, and be of benefit to our
    country at large.</p>
    <p>One acre of ground, if well farmed, will produce from fifty to one hundred bushels
    of potatoes, but say sixty on an average. One hundred farmers each planting one acre,
    would yield six thousand bushels, which will yield at least two gallons of spirit to
    each bushel; thus, twelve thousand gallons of wholesome spirit may be produced, and
    with care, as good as necessary to be drank. Each farmer proceeding in this way,
    would have one hundred and twenty gallons spirit, as much as he may have oc<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>casion to use in the
    year, which would save the price of some acres of wheat or one hundred and twenty
    gallons rye whiskey. Each acre worked in potatoes will be in better order to receive
    a crop of wheat, barley, rye, or any kind of grain, than from any other culture. The
    farmer often receiving the advantage of a double crop, at the expense of seed and
    labor. They grow equally well in every soil and climate, in poor as well as rich
    ground&mdash;provided the thin soil be manured, and the potatoes plastered with
    plaster of Paris; and moreover, they are easier prepared for distilling than either
    apples, rye or corn, as I shall show hereafter when I come to treat of the mode of
    preparation; and in order to demonstrate the advantages that would arise to the
    farmer and distiller; I add a statement of the probable profits of ten acres of
    potatoes, and that of a like number of acres of rye, to shew which offers the
    greatest advantages.</p>

    <p>Thus a balance of one hundred and thirty two dollars would appear in favor of the
    yield of potatoes.</p>
    <p>I would not pretend to say that ten acres of Potatoes will not take more labor
    than ten acres of rye, but this far I will venture to say, that the profits arising
    from the sale of this brandy, will more than double pay the additional expense of
    raising them, besides the ground will be in much better condition to receive a crop
    of wheat, than the rye ground, nay, will be enriched from the crop, whilst the rye
    ground will be greatly impoverished.</p>

    <h3><i>How to distil Apples.</i></h3>
    <p>Apples ought to be perfectly ripe for distillation, as it has been ascertained
    from repeated trials, that they produce more and better spirit, (as well as cider),
    when fully ripe than if taken green, or the ripe and unripe mixed&mdash;if taken
    mixed it will not be found practicable to grind them evenly, or equally fine; those
    fully ripe will be well ground, whilst those hard and unripe will be little more than
    broken or slightly bruised&mdash;and when this coarse and fine mixture is put into a
    hogshead to work or ferment, that fully ripe and fine ground, will immediately begin,
    and will be nearly if not quite done working before the other begins, and of course
    nearly all the spirit contained in the unripe fruit will be lost&mdash;and if it is
    left standing until the ill ground unripe fruit is thoroughly fermented, and done
    working, you will perceive that a large portion of the spirit contained in the ripe
    well ground fruit is evaporated and of course lost.<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>
    <p>But if the fruit be all ripe and evenly ground, of course then it will work
    regularly and can be distilled in due and right order, and will produce the greatest
    quantity of spirit, and much superior to that produced from uneven, ill-ground or
    unripe fruit.</p>
    <p>Apples cannot be ground too fine.</p>
    <h4>ART. X.</h4>
    <h3><i>How to order Apples in the Hogsheads.</i></h3>
    <p>When the apples are ground put them into open hogsheads to ferment, taking care
    not to fill them too full, or they will work over; set them under cover, as the sun
    will sour them too soon, if permitted to operate on them, and by his heat extract a
    considerable quantity of the spirit, if the weather be warm they will work fast
    enough, provided you have a sufficient supply of hogsheads to keep your stills agoing
    in due time and order; about twenty hogsheads are suf<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>ficient to keep one singling still of
    one hundred and ten gallons agoing, if you distil the pumice with the juice, but if
    you press off the apples after they are done working, you must have three times that
    number.</p>
    <p>In warm weather five or six days is long enough for apples to work, as it is
    always better to distil them before they are quite done working, then to let them
    stand one hour after the fermentation ceases.</p>
    <h4>ART. XI.</h4>
    <h3><i>How to work Apples slow or fast.</i></h3>
    <p>If the hogsheads ripens too fast for your stills, add every day to each hogshead
    four gallons cold spring water, putting it into a hole made in the centre of the
    apples, with a large round stick of wood; by thus putting it into the centre of the
    hogshead, it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
    will chill the fermentation, and thereby prevent the fruit from becoming ripe sooner
    than it may suit the convenience of the distiller. But I think it advisable that
    distillers should take in no more apples than they can properly manage in due
    time.</p>
    <p>If the weather be cold, and the apples do not ripen so fast as you wish, then add
    every twelve hours, four gallons boiling, or warm water, which will ripen them if the
    weather be not too cold in four days at farthest.</p>
    <h4>ART. XII.</h4>
    <h3><i>How to judge when Apples are ready for distilling.</i></h3>
    <p>Put your hand down into the hogsheads amongst the apples as far as you can, and
    bring out a handful of pugs&mdash;squeeze them in your hand, through your fingers,
    observe if there be any core, or lumps of apples un-<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>digested, if none, you may consider
    them as sufficiently fermented and quite ready for distilling. It may also be
    ascertained by tasting and smelling the cider or juice, which rises in the hole
    placed in the centre; if it tastes sweet and smells strong, it is not yet ready, but
    when quite fermented, the taste will be sour, and smell strong, which is the proper
    taste for distilling. A nice discriminating attention is necessary to ascertain
    precisely, when the fermentation ceases, which is the proper moment for distillation,
    and I would recommend, rather to anticipate, than delay one hour after this
    period.</p>
    <h4>ART. XIII.</h4>
    <h3><i>How to fill and order the singling Still, when running Apple
    singlings</i>.</h3>
    <p>When you perceive your apples ready for distilling, fill the singling still with
    apples and water; using about half a hogshead<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89"
    id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span> apples in a still of 110 gallons, the residue water,
    first having cleaned the still well, and greased her previous to filling&mdash;put
    fire under her and bring her ready to head, as quick as possible, stirring the
    contents well with a broom until ready to head, of which you can judge by the warmth
    of the apples and water, which must be rather warm to bear your hand in it any length
    of time. Wash the still head and worm clean, put on the head, paste it, keeping a
    good fire until she runs at the worm; run off 14 gallons briskly, and catch the
    feints in a bucket to throw into the next still full, if the singling still too fast,
    provided she does not smoke at the worm. When the first still full is off, and before
    you go to fill her the second time, draw or spread the coals that may be under her,
    in the furnace, and fill the furnace with wood. Shut up your furnace door and put in
    your damper; by proceeding thus, you cool the still and avoid burning her; this plan
    I deem preferable to watering out the fire. When empty, rinse the still round with
    cold water, scrape and grease her, then she will be ready to receive a second
    charge.</p>
    <p>Care is necessary in scraping and greasing your still every time she is emptied,
    if this is neglected, the brandy may be burnt and the still injured.<span

    <h3><i>How to double Apple Brandy.</i></h3>
    <p>Fill the doubling still with singlings, and add a quart of lime, (which will clear
    it) put fire under her and bring her to a run briskly&mdash;after she runs, lessen
    the fire and run her as slow as possible. Slow running will prevent any of the spirit
    from escaping, and make more and better brandy, than fast running.&mdash;Let the
    liquor filter thro a flannel cloth from the worm.<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>
    <h4>ART. XV.</h4>
    <h3><i>How to prepare Peaches.</i></h3>
    <p>Peaches like apples ought to be equally ripe, in order to insure an equal and
    regular fermentation&mdash;for where ripe and unripe fruit are thrown into the same
    hogshead, and ordered for distillation in this way a disadvantage is sustained. I
    therefore recommend to farmers and distillers, when picking the peaches to assort
    them when putting them in hogsheads, all soft ripe peaches may go together, as also
    those which are hard and less ripe&mdash;this will enable a more regular
    fermentation, and though the hard and less ripe, will take a longer time, than the
    soft and ripe to ferment, and yield less, yet the disadvantage will not be so great,
    as if mixed.</p>
    <p>They ought to be ground in a mill with metal nuts, that the stone and kernel<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span> may be well broken.
    The kernel when thus broken will give a finer flavor to the brandy, and increase the
    quantity.</p>
    <p>When they are ground they must be placed in hogsheads and worked in the same way
    with apples, but distilled sooner or they will lose much more spirit by standing any
    time after fermentation than apples. It is therefore better to distil them a short
    time before they are done working than at any period after.</p>
    <h4>ART. XVI.</h4>
    <h3><i>How to double and single Peach Brandy.</i></h3>
    <p>The same process must be observed in running off peaches as in apples, except that
    the singling still ought not to be run so fast, nor so much fire kept under her, and
    more water used to prevent burning.</p>

    <h4>ARTICLE I.</h4>
    <h3><i>The best method of setting Stills.</i></h3>
    <p>If stills are not set right, great injury may accrue to them, in burning and
    damaging the sides, singeing the whiskey, and wasting of fuel too, are not the only
    disadvantages; but more damage may be done in six<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span> months, than would pay a man of
    judgment for putting up twenty pair.</p>
    <p>If they are set with their bottoms to the fire, they are very apt to burn, without
    the utmost care of the distiller, in stirring her when newly filled with cold beer,
    until she is warm, and by previously greasing the bottom well when empty. If wood be
    plenty, stills ought to be set on an arch, but if scarce, the bottom ought to be set
    to the fire. The following method is calculated for a furnace of either two or four
    feet long, and with the bottoms exposed, or on an arch as the distiller may
    fancy.</p>
    <p>Make up a quantity of well worked mortar, composed of the greater proportion of
    good clay, a little lime and cut straw.</p>
    <p>Lay the bottom of the furnace with flag stones, or good brick, from two to four
    feet long, as may be deemed most proper, let it be from twelve to sixteen inches
    wide, and from twelve to fourteen high. Then if it is designed to turn an arch, set
    the end of a brick on each wall of the furnace, leaning them over the furnace, till
    they meet in the middle&mdash;so continue the range on each side, until the furnace
    is completely covered in, leaving a small hole for the flue leading to<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span> the chimney behind,
    leaning towards the side, from which the flue is to be started, to proceed round the
    bilge of the still, which passage must be ten by four inches wide.</p>
    <p>After completing the arch as described, lay thereon a complete bed of mortar, well
    mixed with cut straw, set the still thereon, levelling her so that she will nearly
    empty her self by the stoop towards the cock; then fill up all round her with mortar
    to the lower rivets, carefully preventing any stone or brick from touching her, (as
    they would tend to burn her) ... then build the fender or fenders; being a wall
    composed of brickbats and clay well mixed with cut straw, build it from the
    commencement of the flue, and continue it about half round the still ... this is to
    prevent the flames from striking the still sides, in its hot state, immediately after
    it leaves the furnace, presuming that it will terminate before it reaches the end of
    this little wall or fender, between which, and the still, a space of two inches ought
    to be left for the action of the heat, which space preserves, and prevents the wall
    or fender, from burning the still; the mode in common practice, being to place it
    against the still, which will certainly singe or burn her. When this defender is
    finished, commence a wall, which continue round, laying a<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span> brick for a foundation, about four
    inches from the lower rivets; thus raising this wall for the flue, continuing it at
    an equal distance from the still, leaving a concave to correspond with the bilge of
    the still, and to be of precisely the same width and height all round the still. This
    precaution is absolutely necessary in building the wall of the flue exactly to
    correspond with the form of the still, and equally distant all round, for reasons
    1st. The fire acts with equal force on every part of the still, and a greater heat
    may be applied to her, without burning. 2d. It has a great tendency to prevent the
    still house from smoking.</p>
    <p>When the wall of the flue is completed round the still, and raised so high, that a
    brick when laid on the top of the wall will extend to the rivets in the breast of the
    still or upper rivets, then completely plaster very smooth and even, the inside of
    the flue, and then cover the flue with a layer of brick, with a slight fall, or
    leaning a little from the still outwards, so that if water were dropped thereon, it
    would run off outwardly, carefully laying a layer of clay on the top of the wall, on
    which the brick may rest, and thereby prevent the brick from burning the still;
    carefully forming the brick with the trowel, so as to fit the wall and rest more<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
    safely&mdash;cautiously covering them well with clay, &amp;c. and closing every
    crevice or aperture, to prevent smoak from coming thro' or the heat from deserting
    the flue till it passes to the chimney from the flue; then fill the still with water,
    and put a flow fire under her to dry the work. When the wall begins to dry, lay on a
    coat of mortar, (such as the next receipt directs), about two inches thick, when this
    begins to dry, lay a white coat of lime and sand-mortar, smoothing well with a
    trowel; rubbing it constantly and pressing it severely with the trowel to prevent it
    from cracking.</p>
    <p>There are many modes of setting stills and bringing the fire up by flues variously
    constructed, but I have found the foregoing plan to afford as great a saving of fuel,
    and bringing the still to a boil as early as any other.</p>

    <h3><i>How to prevent the Plastering round Stills from cracking.</i></h3>
    <p>This method of making water proof plastering on stills, is done entirely in making
    the mortar, and putting it on, in making which, good clay and lime are absolutely
    necessary.</p>
    <p>When the mortar for the first coat is thoroughly worked, put as much brock of rye
    straw into it, as can be worked in, so that when the coat is put on, it may have a
    greater appearance of straw than mortar, when dry, and covered with the second coat
    composed of lime mortar, well rubbed and pressed with the trowel until it be dry. A
    covering put on of those materials, will be found to continue firm and compact

    <h3><i>The best method of boiling two, three or more Stills or Kettles with one fire
    or furnace</i>.</h3>
    <p>This method has been found to answer in some instances, and may perhaps do
    generally if properly managed. I will here give the result of my own experiments.</p>
    <p>I set a singling still holding 180 gallons on a furnace of 18 by 14 inches, and 4
    feet six inches long, with the bottom to the fire, she had a common head and worm
    with scrapers and chains in her. I extended the flue, (or after passing it round
    her), to the doubling still which it likewise went round&mdash;but to prevent too
    much heat from passing to the doubling still, I fixed a shutter in the flue of the
    singling still, immediately above the intersection of the flue of the doubling still,
    to turn all the heat round her, and another shutter in the flue of the doubling still
    at the intersection of the flue of the singling still, to shut the heat off from the
    doubling still if necessary.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100"
    id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>
    <p>With this fixture I run six hogsheads off in every twenty four hours and doubled
    the same, with the same heat and fire. I likewise had a boiler under which I kept
    another fire, which two fires consumed about three cords and an half of wood per
    week, distilling at the rate of sixty-five bushels of grain per week, and making
    about one hundred and ninety gallons in the same time.</p>
    <p>Before I adopted this method I kept four fires agoing, and made about the same
    quantity of whiskey, consuming about four and an half cords of wood per week, and was
    obliged to have the assistance of an additional distiller per week.</p>
    <p>I have since heard of the adoption of this plan with more success than I
    experienced.</p>

    still you fill&mdash;as the first shot generally contains something that will give an
    unpleasant taste and colour to the gin. When it looses<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span> proof at the worm, take the keg
    away that contains the gin, and bring it down to a proper strength with rain water,
    which must previously have been prepared, by having been evaporated and condensed in
    the doubling still and cooling tub.</p>
    <p>This gin when fined, and two years old, will be equal, if not superior to Holland
    gin.</p>
    <p>The isinglass, lime water and salt, helps to refine it in the still, and the
    juniper berries gives the flavor or taste of Holland gin.</p>
    <p>About thirteen pounds of good berries, are sufficient for one barrel.</p>
    <p>Be careful to let the gin as it runs from the worm, pass thro' a flannel cloth,
    which will prevent many unpleasant particles from passing into the liquor, which are
    contracted in the condensation, and the overjuice imbibed in its passage thro' the
    worm.</p>

    <h3><i>The best method of making common country Gin.</i></h3>
    <p>Take of singlings a sufficient quantity to fill the doubling still, put therein
    ten or twelve pounds of juniper berries, with one shovel full of ashes, and two
    ounces alum&mdash;put on the bead, and run her off, as is done in making whiskey.
    This is the common mode of making country gin; but is in this state little superior
    to whiskey, save as to smell and flavor.</p>
    <p>It is therefore in my mind, that the mode of clarifying, prescribed, ought to be
    pursued in all distilleries, so far as necessary to make a sufficient quantity of
    good spirit for any market convenient&mdash;the supply of respectable neighbors, who
    may prefer giving a trifle more per gallon, than for common stuff and for domestic
    use. And moreover,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg
    108]</a></span> I think the distiller will meet a generous price for such clarified,
    and pure spirit, as he may send to a large mercantile town for sale&mdash;as brewers
    and others, frequently desire such for mixing, brewing, making brandies in the French
    and Spanish mode, and spirits after the Jamaica custom. And after the establishment
    of a filtering tub or hopper, prepared as before described, with holes, flannel or
    woollen cloth, and plenty of maple charcoal, and burnt brick-dust, a distiller may
    always find leisure to attend to the filtration; indeed it will be found as simple
    and easy, as the process for making ley from ashes in the country for soap. But I
    would suggest that spirit prepared and clarified in this way, should be put into the
    sweetest and perfectly pure casks.</p>
    <p>New barrels will most certainly impart color, and perhaps some taste, which would
    injure the sale, if intended for a commercial town market, and for brewing, or mixing
    with spirits, from which it is to receive its flavor.</p>
    <p>For my own use, I would put this spirit into a nice sweet cask, and to each barrel
    I would add a pint of regularly, and well browned wheat, not burned but roasted as
    much as coffee.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg
    109]</a></span></p>
    <p>The taste of peach brandy may be imparted to it by a quantity of peach stone
    kernels, dried, pounded and stirred into the cask; in this way, those who are fond of
    the peach brandy flavor, may drink it without becoming subject to the pernicious
    consequences that arise from the constant use of peach brandy. Peach brandy, unless
    cleansed of its gross and cloying properties, or is suffered to acquire some years of
    age, has a cloying effect on the stomach, which it vitiates, by destroying the effect
    of the salival and gastric juices, which have an effect on aliment, similar to that
    of yeast on bread, and by its singular properties prevents those juices from the
    performance of their usual functions in the fermentation of the food taken into the
    stomach&mdash;producing acid and acrimonious matter, which in warm climates generates
    fevers and agues. Apple brandy has not quite a similar but equally pernicious effect,
    which age generally removes&mdash;indeed, age renders it a very fine liquor, and when
    diluted with water, makes a very happy beverage, gives life and animation to the
    digesting powers, and rarely leaves the stomach heavy, languid and cloyed. Then both
    those, (indeed, all liquors,) ought to be avoided when new, by persons of delicate
    habit, and those who do not exercise freely. A severe exercise and rough life,
    generally enables the stomach to digest the most coarse food, by liquor, however
    new.</p>
    <h3><i>On fining Liquors.</i></h3>
    <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
    <p>Isinglass is almost universally used in fining liquors. Take about half an ounce
    to the barrel&mdash;beat it fine with a hammer, lay it in a convenient vessel, pour
    thereon two gallons whiskey, or a like quantity of the liquor you are about to fine,
    let it soak two or three days, or till it becomes soft enough to mix&mdash;then stir
    it effectually, and add the white and shells of half a dozen eggs&mdash;beat them up
    together and pour them into the cask that is to be fined, then stir it in the cask,
    bung it slightly, after standing three or four days it will be sufficiently fine, and
    may be drawn off into a clean cask.</p>

    <p>One pound of brown sugar burnt in a skillet almost to a cinder, add a quart of

    quantity will color three barrels.</p>
    <p>A pint of well parched wheat put into a barrel will colour it, and give more the
    appearance of a naturally acquired colour, and an aged taste or flavor.<span

    <h3><i>To give an aged flavor to Whiskey.</i></h3>
    <p>This process ought to be attended to by every distiller, and with all whiskey, and
    if carefully done, would raise the character, and add to the wholesomeness of
    domestic spirits.</p>
    <p>It may be done by clarifying the singlings as it runs from the still&mdash;let the
    funnel be a little broader than usual, cover it with two or more layers of flannel,
    on which place a quantity of finely beaten maple charcoal, thro' which let the
    singlings filter into your usual receiving cask. When doubling, put some lime and
    charcoal in the still, and run the liquor thro' a flannel&mdash;when it loses proof
    at the worm, take away the cask, and bring it to proof with rain water that has been
    distilled. To each hogshead of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114"
    id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span> whiskey, use a pound of Bohea tea, and set it in
    the sun for two weeks or more, then remove it to a cool cellar, and when cold it will
    have the taste and flavor of old whiskey. If this method was pursued by distillers
    and spirits made 2d and 3d proof, it would not only benefit the seller, but would be
    an advantage to the buyer and consumer&mdash;and was any particular distiller to
    pursue this mode and brand his casks, it would raise the character of his liquor, and
    give it such an ascendancy as to preclude the sale of any other, beyond what scarcity
    or an emergency might impel in a commercial city.</p>
    <p>If distillers could conveniently place their liquor in a high loft, and suffer it
    to fall to the cellar by a pipe, it would be greatly improved by the friction and
    ebullition occasioned in the descent and fall.<span class='pagenum'><a

    <p>Some seasons are better for fermentation than others. Should a hail storm occur in

    is dissolved, for it will not work well.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116"

    <p>If a thundergust happens when the hogsheads are in the highest state of
    fermentation, the working will nearly cease, and the stuff begin to contract an
    acidity. And when in the spring the frost is coming out of the ground, it is
    unfortunate when the distiller is obliged to use water impregnated with the fusions
    of the frost, such being very injurious to fermentation&mdash;Those changes and
    occurrences ought to be marked well, to enable a provision against their effects.
    This will be found difficult without the assistance of a barometer, to determine the
    changes of the weather&mdash;a thermometer, to ascertain correctly the heat of the
    atmosphere, and to enable a medium and temperature of the air to be kept up in the
    distillery; and from observation to acquire a knowledge of the degree of heat or
    warmth, in which the mashing in the hogsheads ferments to the greatest advantage, and
    when this is ascertained, a distiller may in a close house sufficiently ventilated,
    and provided with convenient windows, always keep up the degree or temperature in the
    air, most adapted to the promotion of fermentation, by opening his windows or doors
    to admit air, as a corrective; or by keeping them closed in proportion to the
    coldness of the weather:&mdash;And a hydrometer, useful in measuring and ascertaining
    the extent of water. Instructions for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117"
    id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span> the management of those instruments generally
    attend them, it is therefore unnecessary for me to go into a detail on this
    subject.&mdash;But it is absolutely necessary that the careful and scientific
    distiller should possess them, especially the two former, to guard against the
    changes of the weather, and preserve the atmosphere in the distillery, always equally
    warm.</p>
    <h4>ART. II.</h4>
    <h3><i>Observations on Water.</i></h3>
    <p>Distillers cannot be too particular in selecting good water for distilling, when
    about to erect distilleries.</p>
    <p>Any water will do for the use of the condensing tubs or coolers, but there are
    many kinds of water that will not answer the purpose of mashing or fermenting to
    advantage; among which are snow and limestone water, either of which possess such
    properties, as to require one fifth more of grain to<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span> yield the same quantity of liquor,
    that would be produced while using river water.</p>
    <p>Any water will answer the distillers purpose, that will dissolve soap, or will
    wash well with soap, or make a good lather for shaving.</p>
    <p>River or creek water is the best for distilling except when mixed with snow or
    land water from clay or ploughed ground. If no river or creek water can be procured,
    that from a pond, supplied by a spring, if the bottom be not very muddy will do, as
    the exposure to the sun, will generally have corrected those properties inimical to
    fermentation. Very hard water drawn from a deep well, and thrown into a cistern, or
    reservoir and exposed to the sun and air for two or three days, has been used in
    mashing with success, with a small addition of chop grain or malt. I consider rain
    water as next in order to that from the river, for mashing and fermentation.
    Mountain, slate, gravel and running water, are all preferable to limestone, unless
    impregnated with minerals&mdash;many of which are utterly at variance with
    fermentation. With few exceptions, I have found limestone, and all spring water too
    hard for mashing, scalding or fermenting.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119"

    <h4>ART. III.</h4>
    <h3><i>Precautions against Fire</i></h3>
    <p>Cannot be too closely attended to. The store house, or cellar for keeping whiskey
    in, ought to be some distance from the distillery, and the liquor deposited, and all
    work necessary in it done by day, to avoid all possible danger arising from candles
    or lamps, from which many serious calamities have occurred. Suppose the cellar or
    place of deposit to be entered at night by a person carrying a lamp or candle, and a
    leaking cask takes his attention, in correcting the leak, he may set his lamp on the
    ground covered with whiskey, or he may drop by chance one drop of burning oil on a
    small stream of whiskey, which will communicate like gun powder, and may cause an
    explosion, which may in all likelihood destroy the stock on hand, the house, and the
    life of the individual.&mdash;On this subject it is not necessary I should say much,
    as every individual employed about a distillery must have some knowledge of the value
    of life and property.</p>

    <h4>ARTICLE I.</h4>
    <h3><i>The duty of the owner of a Distillery.</i></h3>
    <p>The main and first object of the proprietor of a distillery, is gain or
    profit&mdash;and the second, it is natural, should be the acquiring a character or
    reputation for his liquor, and a desire to excel neighboring dis<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg
    121]</a></span>tilleries&mdash;in both of which, neglect and sloth will insure
    disappointment.</p>
    <p>The active, cleanly, industrious and attentive proprietor uses the following
    means.</p>
    <p>First. He provides his distillery with good sound grain, hogsheads, barrels, kegs,
    funnels, brooms, malt, hops, wood, &amp;c. of all of which he has in plenty, nicely
    handled, and in good order. He also provides an hydrometer, thermometer, and
    particularly a barometer, duly observing the instructions accompanying each, their
    utility and particular uses.</p>
    <p>Secondly. He is careful that his distiller does his duty, of which he can be
    assured only, by rising at four o'clock, winter and summer, to see if the distiller
    is up and at his business, and that every thing is going well&mdash;and to prepare
    every thing and article necessary&mdash;to attend and see the hogs fed, and that the
    potale or slop be cold when given, and that the cattle be slopped&mdash;that the
    stills are not burning, nor the casks leaking, &amp;c. &amp;c. He observes the
    barometer, points out any changes in the weather, and pays an unremitted attention,
    seeing that all things are in perfect order, and enforcing any changes he may deem
    necessary.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg
    122]</a></span></p>
    <p>On the other hand, indolence begets indolence&mdash;The proprietor who sleeps till
    after sun rise, sets an example to his distiller and people, which is too often
    followed&mdash;the distillery becomes cold from the want of a regular fire being kept
    up in her&mdash;the hogsheads cease to work or ferment, of consequence, they will not
    turn out so much whiskey&mdash;and there is a general injury sustained. And it may
    often occur, that during one, two or three days in the week, the distiller may want
    grain, wood, malt, hops or some necessary&mdash;and perhaps all those things may be
    wanting during the same day ... and of course, the distiller stands idle. The cattle,
    hogs, &amp;c. suffer; and from this irregular mode of managing, I have known the
    proprietor to sink money, sink in reputation, and rarely ever to attribute the effect
    to the right cause.</p>
    <h3><i>System and Method.</i></h3>
    <p>A well timed observance of system and method are necessary in all the various
    branches of business pursued, and without which none succeeds so well.</p>
    <p>And whilst the industrious, attentive and cleanly proprietor, may with certainty,
    cal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>culate
    on a handsome profit and certain advantages to result from this business. He who
    conducts carelessly, may as certainly reckon on sustaining a general loss.</p>
    <h4>ART. II.</h4>
    <h3><i>The duty of an hired Distiller</i></h3>
    <p>Is to rise at four o'clock every morning. Wash and clean out the boiler, fill her
    up with clean water, put fire under her, and to clean, fill and put fire under the
    singling still&mdash;to collect and put in order for mashing, his hogsheads&mdash;and
    as soon as the water is warm enough in the boiler to begin mashing, which he ought to
    finish as early in the day as possible; for when the mashing is done, he will have
    time to scald and clean<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg
    124]</a></span> his vessels, to attend his doubling and singling still, to get in
    wood for next day, and to make his stock yeast, if new yeast is wanting. In short,
    the distiller ought to have his mashing finished by twelve o'clock every day, to see
    and have every thing in the still house, under his eye at the same time; but he ought
    never to attempt doing more than one thing at once&mdash;a distiller ought never to
    be in a hurry, but always busy. I have always remarked that the bustling unsteady
    distiller attempts doing two or three things at once, and rarely ever has his
    business in the same state of forwardness with the steady methodical character.<span

    <p>Raising, feeding and fattening hogs on potale, a business pursued and highly
    spoken of, but from my experience I have discovered that few good pigs can be raised
    entirely on potale&mdash;as it has a tendency to gripe and scour too much; but after
    they are weaned and a little used with slop, they will thrive well.<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>
    <p>If a hog in a cold morning comes running to a trough full of slop, that is almost
    boiling, and is very hungry&mdash;their nature is so gluttonous &amp; voracious, that
    it will take several mouthfuls before it feels the effects of the heat, and endangers
    the scalding of the mouth, throat and entrails&mdash;and which may be followed by
    mortification and death;&mdash;moreover, hot feeding is the cause of so many deaths,
    and ill-looking unhealthy pigs, about some distilleries&mdash;which inconvenience
    might be avoided by taking care to feed or fill the troughs before the boiling slop
    is let out from the still.</p>
    <p>A distiller cannot be too careful of his hogs&mdash;as with care, they will be
    found the most productive stock he can raise&mdash;and without care unproductive.</p>
    <p>The offals of distilleries and mills cannot be more advantageously appropriated
    than in raising of hogs&mdash;they are prolific, arrive at maturity in a short
    period, always in demand. Pork generally sells for more than beef, and the lard
    commands a higher price than tallow; of the value of pork and every part of this
    animal, it is unnecessary for me to enter into detail; of their great value and
    utility, almost every person is well acquainted.<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>
    <p>The hog pens and troughs ought to be kept clean and in good order, the still slop
    salted two or three times a week; when fattening, hogs should be kept in a close pen,
    and in the summer a place provided to wallow in water.</p>
    <p>Hogs that are fed on potale, ought not to lie out at night, as dew, rain and snow
    injures them&mdash;indeed such is their aversion to bad weather, that when it comes
    on, or only a heavy shower of rain, away they run, full speed, each endeavoring to be
    foremost, all continually crying out, until they reach their stye or place of
    shelter.</p>
    <p>At the age of nine months, this animal copulates first, and frequently earlier,
    but it is better engendering should be prevented, till the age of eighteen
    months&mdash;for at an earlier age, the litter is uniformly small, and weakly, and
    frequently do not survive, besides the growth is injured. It is therefore better not
    to turn a sow to breeding, till from 18 to 24 months old.</p>
    <p>The sow goes four months with pig, and yields her litter at the commencement of
    the fifth; soon after encourages and receives the boar, and thus produces two litters
    in the year. I have known an instance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132"
    id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span> of three litters having been produced in the year
    from one female.</p>
    <p>A sow ought not to be permitted to suckle her pigs more than two or three weeks,
    after which eight or nine only should be left with her, the rest sold, or sent to
    market, or killed for use&mdash;at the age of three weeks they are fit for eating, if
    the sow is well fed. A few sows will serve, and those kept for breeding, well
    selected from the litter, the residue, cut and splayed. Care and pains is due in the
    choice of the breed of hogs&mdash;the breeder had then better procure good ones, and
    of a good race at once, tho' the expense and trouble may seem material in the outset,
    yet the keeping will be the same, and the produce perhaps fifty per cent more.</p>
    <p>After the pigs are weaned, they ought to be fed for the first two weeks on milk,
    water and bran, after which potale may be used in the room of milk. I would recommend
    a little mixed potale from an early period, and increase it, so as to render them
    accustomed to the slop gradually.</p>

    <h3><i>Of the Diseases of Hogs.</i></h3>
    <p>The only disease that I know of which seems to be peculiar to hogs, is a kind of
    leprosy, commonly called measles, when it seizes them, they become dull and sleepy,
    if the tongue is pulled out, the palate and throat will be found full of blackish
    spots, which appear also on the head, neck, and on the whole body&mdash;the creature
    is scarce able to stand, and the roots of its bristles are bloody. As this disorder
    proceeds chiefly from their gluttony and filth, and hot drinking of potale and slop;
    to remedy which, it would be commendable to feed on cold potale, or scarcely milk
    warm, to keep them clean, to mix salt occasionally with the potale&mdash;tar their
    trough once a month, and give them a little ground antimony.<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>
    <p>In fattening hogs I have known them improve rapidly, after eating the warm ashes
    from a fresh burned brush heap. Hickory or willow ashes will have an effect to
    destroy worms, and I think ought to be used, they will eat it dry, when put in their
    troughs.</p>

    <h3><i>On feeding Cattle and Milch Cows.</i></h3>
    <p>Potale is a great creator of milk, and will increase the quantity greatly in cows
    yielding milk, but no so good. Young cattle thrive very well, that get hay or straw
    during the night. To fatten cattle there ought to be mixed with the slop, a little
    oil meal, or chopped flaxseed, or chopped corn. The cattle kept on still slop ought
    to get plenty of salt. Warm potale injures their teeth.</p>

    <h3><i>Observations on erecting Distilleries.</i></h3>
    <p>Those who are about to erect distilleries, have a handsome subject for
    consideration; the advantages, and the probable disadvantages that may arise from
    building on a particular site, or seat. The contiguity<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span> to a chopping mill is a material
    consideration&mdash;Wood forming an important article, should be taken into
    view&mdash;Grain merits also a great share of attention. The water which forms, by no
    means, the least important ingredient should be well analyzed; and a share of thought
    is due to the subject of a market for the whiskey, spirits and pork, produced from
    the establishment.&mdash;And should the water then prove good, soft and proper for
    fermentation, can be bro't over head, and the chopping mill is not very inconvenient,
    and wood convenient and cheap, and grain plenty and at reasonable prices, and a
    market within one hundred miles, I have little doubt but that with proper economy and
    observance of system, the establishment will prove very productive; and may be
    progressed in with cheerfulness, and a reasonable hope of a fair retribution to the
    owner.</p>
    <p>A proper seat being fixed on, with sufficient fall to bring the water over head,
    for it is very material, and an immense saving of labor&mdash;material, because it
    prevents a loss, in running the stills, from pumping or want of water in the cooling
    tubs. The size of the house follows, as requiring some more than usual
    calculation&mdash;houses are generally made too small, giving great inconvenience,
    and preventing that nice attention to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137"
    id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span> cleanliness, which forms a very important item in
    the process of distilling. I would recommend a size sufficiently large for three
    stills, and to mash six hogsheads per day&mdash;one of col. Anderson's patent
    improved stills, I would consider, in many situations, as most desirable; at all
    events, I would recommend the preparation of room enough for three stills, if even it
    should be the intention of the owner to erect but two&mdash;for it is very probable,
    that after some experience, he may determine to pursue the business more extensively,
    and add the patent still.</p>
    <p>The size then established, I would recommend the lower story to be 10 feet high,
    this will leave room for the heated, or rarefied air to ascend in the summer above
    the cooler, and more necessary air in the warm season of the year, and prevent the
    unpleasant effect of a too warm air on the mashing hogsheads, and the sowing of the
    stuff in fermentation&mdash;and moreover, prevent the unpleasant effects of smoak on
    the distillers eyes. But it is important that the house should be erected on level
    ground with doors opposite each other, with plenty of windows to afford a draft and
    recourse of air, at pleasure, during the warm season; and so that in the winter it
    may be closed and preserved perfectly warm&mdash;to which<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span> end it is most expedient the lower
    story should be well built with stone and lime, and neatly plastered&mdash;the
    windows well glazed, with shutters &amp;c. Thus provided, and a thermometer placed in
    the centre of the house, a proper temperature may be kept up in the air of the
    house&mdash;for there is a certain degree of warmth which exceeds for
    fermentation&mdash;this degree of heat, then correctly ascertained by the distiller,
    he may by a close attention to his duties, fires and the thermometer, always keep the
    air of the house in nearly that same and most approved state; and even by a well
    timed observation guard against storms and casualties. To effectuate this grand and
    important object, some have divided the stills, placing the boiler at one end, and a
    singling and doubling still at the other; this mode will ensure, in cold weather, the
    success of the measure more fully&mdash;others have placed all the stills in the
    centre of the building&mdash;a plan that will do better in the winter than in the
    summer, and one I think less favourably of than that of dividing them.</p>
    <p>During the winter, the north or northwest side of the house should be kept quite
    close, permitting the house to be lighted from the more temperate southward exposure.
    To calculate the window sashes to open by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139"

    <h3><i>On Wines.</i></h3>
    <p>Presuming this work may be rendered more desirable to farmers, from the
    introduction of some receipts for making domestic wine from the common hedge
    grapes,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span> or
    such as are common on fence rows and on high rich grounds, and which are pleasantly
    flavored after receiving frost, and also for making cider in the best mode for
    preservation. I have extracted a few from various author's.</p>
    <h3><i>Receipt for making Domestic Wine from the Autumn Blue Grape.</i></h3>
    <p>About the latter end of September or about the first white frosts, gather the
    grapes which with us grow along old fences and hedges&mdash;pick all the grapes from
    the stems that are juicy, allowing two bushels thus picked a little heaped, to the
    barrel. Mash them well between your hands in small parcels, either in earthen pans,
    or some convenient small vessels&mdash;put them when mashed into a tub together, and
    add a little water so as to soak the pumice....<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span> After stirring them well together,
    squeeze the pumice out from the liquor with your hands, as clean as you
    can&mdash;then strain the juice through a hair sieve. If the juice seems not all
    extracted from the pumice at one soaking and squeezing, put water to the pumice and
    squeeze them over again; take care not to add too much water, lest there should be
    more than the cask will hold. If after all the ingredients are added, the cask is not
    full, it may then be filled up with water. To the liquor thus prepared, add two
    pounds of good, clean, rich low priced brown sugar, per gallon, stirring it in the
    tub till all the sugar be dissolved; let it remain in the tub, and in a day or two it
    will ferment, and the scum rise to the top, which must be carefully skimmed
    off&mdash;then put the wine into a clean nice barrel&mdash;do not bung it up tight.
    There is generally a fermentation in it the spring following, when the grape vines
    are in blossom, but racking it off just before that season will prevent its working
    too much. If it is wanted to be soon ripe for use, put a quart of good old brandy
    after it is racked off, to the barrel, and give it air by leaving the bung quite
    loose.</p>
    <p>This mode of manufacturing wine for domestic use, is convenient and not expensive
    to those who have it in their power to ma<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142"
    id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>nufacture maple sugar. But the nice housewife or
    husbandmen of ingenuity, will, I fancy, devise some more neat mode of compressing the
    juice from the grape&mdash;as pressing it by the hand, would seem less cleanly,
    though the fermentation generally cleanses sufficiently.</p>
    <h3><i>Currant Wine</i></h3>
    <p>Is managed in the same way. The same quantity of sugar is presumed to
    answer&mdash;The juice is generally well strained thro' cloths, and when well
    stirred, &amp;c. with the sugar, and neatly racked off, is put by in a loft to ripen,
    in sweet casks.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg

    <h3><i>Directions for making Cider, British mode.</i></h3>
    <p>The apples after being thrown into a heap should always be covered from the
    weather. The later the cider is made the better, as the juice is then more perfectly
    ripened, and less danger to be feared from fermentation. Nothing does more harm to
    cider than a mixture of rotten apples with the sound. The apples ought to be ground
    so close as to break the seeds which gives the liquor an agreeable bitter. The pumice
    should be pressed through hair bags, and the juice strained through two sieves, the
    uppermost of hair, the lower of muslin. After this the cider should be put into open
    casks, when great atten<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg
    144]</a></span>tion is necessary to discover the exact time in which the pumice still
    remaining in the juice, rises on the top, which happens from the third to the tenth
    day, according as the weather is more or less warm. This body does not remain on top
    more than two hours; consequently, care should be taken to draw off the cider before
    it sinks, which may be done by means of a plug. When drawn off, the cider is put into
    casks. Particular attention is again required to prevent the fermentation, when the
    least inclination towards it is discovered. This may be done by a small quantity of
    cider spirits, about one gallon to the hogshead. In March the cider should be again
    drawn off, when all risque of fermentation ceases. Then it should be put into good
    sweet casks, and in three years from that time, it will be fit for bottling. Old wine
    casks are to be preferred; those which contain rum are ruinous to cider. Large
    earthen vessels might be made with or without glazing, which would be preferable to
    any wooden vessel whatever. When we compare this with the hasty American mode of
    making cider, it is not to be wondered at that the English cider so infinitely excels
    ours.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>
    <h4>ART. III.</h4>
    <h3><i>The following is a very highly approved American mode of making
    Cider.</i></h3>
    <p>Take care to have every necessary utensil to be made use of in the whole process,
    perfectly clean and free from every foreign smell. For this purpose, before you begin
    your work, let your mill, trough and press be made perfectly clean, by thoroughly
    washing, and if necessary, with scalding water. The casks are another material
    object, and if musty, or any other bad smell, one end should be taken out, and with
    shavings burn the inside; then scrub them clean, and put in the head, scald them well
    afterwards, and drain them perfectly; when dry, bung them tight and keep them in
    a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span> cool
    shady place until wanted for use.&mdash;The apples should be quite ripe, and all the
    unripe and rotten ones, leaves, and every other thing that can tend to give the cider
    any disagreeable taste, carefully separated from them. I have found from careful
    attention and many experiments, that it is a great advantage to the cider to be
    separated from the gross parts as soon as possible; for this purpose, I tried several
    methods: that which I found succeeded the best, I shall now relate, as by following
    it, I was able to preserve my cider in a sound state, though made in the early part
    of the season. I took a large pipe, of about 150 gallons, had one of the heads taken
    out, and on the inside of the other laid on edge, four strips of boards, two inches
    wide, and on these strips placed a false bottom, filled with gimlet holes, three
    inches a part. On this false bottom, I put a hair cloth, (old blanket or swingline
    tow will do) so as to prevent any sand from washing into the space between the true
    and false bottoms; I procured a quantity of coarse sand, which was carefully washed
    in repeated waters, until it would not discolor the clean water&mdash;then dried the
    sand, put it in the pipe, on the hair cloth, (coarse blanket or swingline tow,) about
    9 inches thick.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg
    147]</a></span></p>
    <p>Thus having every thing in readiness, I went through the process of making, as
    quick as possible, by having the apples ground fine early in the morning, putting
    them in the press as fast as they were ground; and then in sufficient quantities
    pressed out the juice, and put it over the sand in the cask, (having previously bored
    a gimlet hole in the side of the cask), between the true and false bottoms, in which
    I introduced a large goose-quill, stopped with another. The pipe was placed so high,
    as to admit of a cask under it, to receive the liquor as it ran from the quill,
    which, if rightly managed, will be perfectly fine, and being put away in a cool
    cellar, and stopped close, will keep well, and prove of an excellent quality.</p>
    <p>This process is easy, and in every person's power to execute, as the liquor, by
    being cleared, from its gross feculences, will not run into that violent
    fermentation, so destructive to the fine vinous flavor, which renders good cider so
    pleasing a drink.</p>
    <p><i>Query.</i> Would not a quart of good apple brandy to each barrel of cider, made
    in this way, prevent any fermentation?</p>
    <p>But it is generally believed that cider is the better for having undergone a
    fermenta<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg
    148]</a></span>tion, becoming then more active and light; cider that has undergone
    condensation, or has been boiled down until strong, has been found to keep sound some
    length of time, but it is too heavy and destructive to the appetite, cloying the
    digesting powers.&mdash;And by too frequent use, I fancy, will ultimately produce
    ague and fevers; and I fear, cider made according to the foregoing receipt, would
    have a similar effect, but in a lesser degree.</p>
    <p>I would recommend after a due attention to cleanliness, in the apple mill, trough,
    press and casks, that the apples be assorted, and having been exposed to the air,
    under a roof or shed some time, selecting the sound only, that they be ground fine,
    and let stand soaking in the pumice twelve hours, and then pressed off, through a
    clean rye straw cheese (being the most common and convenient in the country,) and
    when flowing from the press, a vessel should be provided, with the bottom full of
    gimlet holes, in the style of a riddle, on which lay a coarse cloth, then a layer of
    clean sand, over which a parcel of coarse rye straw, and suffer it to filter thro'
    this vessel into the large receiving tub; the rye straw will intercept the coarser
    pieces of pumice, and may be changed frequently&mdash;This mode will rid the liquor
    of all the coarser pieces of pumice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149"
    id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>&mdash;then I would recommend that the cider should
    be placed in open hogsheads, such as are used for mashing grain in distilleries;
    those being raised about two feet and an half high on logs or a scaffolding, under a
    shade or covering&mdash;a spile hole bored near the bottom of each, so as to admit a
    barrel to stand under the spile&mdash;in this state, I would recommend it to stand
    until it undergoes a fermentation, carefully watching the top, and when the pumice is
    found to have risen, to skim it off carefully, then having previously provided sweet
    barrels, draw it off by the spile hole, adding from a pint to a quart of apple brandy
    to each barrel of strong cider, bung it up tight, and store it where the frost will
    not injure it. In this way, I presume it will keep well&mdash;and if the party be so
    disposed, I would recommend any bottling to be done in April, and during clear
    weather, though it is safe to bottle immediately after having undergone a thorough
    fermentation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg

    <h3><i>The following Receipt to make an excellent American Wine,</i></h3>
    <p>was communicated to the Burlington Society for promoting domestic manufactures, by
    Joseph Cooper, Esq. of Gloucester county, state of New Jersey, and ordered to be
    published;&mdash;which, from its extreme simplicity, and economy, shewing the
    convenience with which a very pleasant, healthful beverage, may be kept by every
    family in our country, is published in this work. And moreover, as it may have, in
    some degree, the happy effects of correcting the baneful and pernicious effects of
    coffee, which is so commonly used for breakfast in our state at present.</p>
    <p>Coffee, when first introduced, was used as a medicine only, and given only in a
    well clarified state, and sparingly&mdash;both from its<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span> soothing and pleasant effect, it
    become common, and now it is almost the only beverage used at breakfast by the
    farmers of Pennsylvania, and indeed, people suppose the morning repast is not
    genteel, unless the board is decorated with this foreign beverage. If it was used in
    a moderately strong well clarified state, it would be less injurious, but it is too
    frequently set down in a non descript state, difficult to be named, mixed with the
    grounds, and so far from clear, as to be entitled to the epithet of muddy, and
    sweetened with bad sugar, carrying with it to the simply ignorant family, using it in
    this state, the cause in a great measure of destroying the tone of the stomach,
    overloading it, and by and by, the introduction of a kind of dumb ague, or chill,
    followed with a fever, and often creating intermitting and remitting
    fevers&mdash;consequences arising out of the free use of bad provisions&mdash;which
    diseases are oftentimes kept up by the use of this infamously prepared coffee, for
    when the country people get sick, coffee is too frequently used as the only diet.</p>
    <p>It is particularly injurious to bilious habits&mdash;souring on the stomach,
    becoming acid, creating acidity, and preventing the glandular juicy supplies from
    producing the usual fermentation of the food in the stomach&mdash;rendering the chyle
    vitiated, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg
    152]</a></span> in its usual route, imparts from the intestines, nourishment to the
    blood. Thus conveying its baneful properties by this active vehicle, chyle to the
    blood, rendering it foetid, discoloured and by and by, often as difficult to be named
    in its adulterated state as the composition which gave rise to it. Had we not very
    many instances of new diseases&mdash;complaints which the most eminent of the medical
    faculty can with difficulty name, or treat with judgment, without first having made
    many essays and experiments fatal to the lives of hundreds, which are increasing with
    every approaching season, and all since the adoption of coffee. (True, the free use
    of ardent spirits and other luxuries operating on the effects of indolence&mdash;of
    habits, produced by the wealth and independence of our agricultural and commercial
    people, and growing out of an imitation of the elevated, affluent of society, born to
    fortune, and the successful professional characters;) a doubt might present itself as
    to the propriety of attributing many of those new complaints to coffee ... but to a
    too plentiful use of bad provisions, and an indulgence of bad habits, we must
    attribute to them. And as badly made coffee is among the most pernicious kinds of
    food, and particularly when taken in the morning on an empty stomach, and that too
    made from very green coffee, (dreadful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153"
    id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>ly poisonous when used too frequently before it
    acquires age and a whiter colour,) it may be condemned with greater propriety. And
    whilst this beverage is condemned and so highly to be disapproved of, it is well if
    we can invent a light, pure, active and healthful beverage to be taken freely,
    between or at meals, calculated in its nature to correct in some degree, the unhappy
    effects of bad provisions&mdash;it is therefore I mention the</p>

    id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span> with water, that the filth might work out of the
    bung hole. When the fermentation moderated, I put the bung in loosely, lest stopping
    it tight, might cause the cask to burst.&mdash;At the end of five or six weeks the
    liquor was drawn off into a tub, and the white of eight eggs well beaten up, with a
    pint of clean sand, were put into it&mdash;I then added a gallon of cider spirit, and
    after mixing the whole well together, I returned it into the cask, which was well
    cleaned, bunged it tight and placed it in a proper situation for racking it off when
    fine. In the month of April following, I drew it off for use, and found it equal in
    my opinion, to almost any foreign wine&mdash;in the opinion of many good judges it
    was superior.</p>
    <p>This success has induced me to repeat the experiments for three years, and I am
    persuaded that by using the clean honey, instead of the comb, as above described;
    such an improvement might be made as would enable the citizens of the United States,
    to supply themselves with a truly federal and wholesome wine, which would not cost
    more than twenty cents per gallon, were all the ingredients procured at the market
    prices, and would have the peculiar advantage over all other wines, hitherto
    attempted in this country, that it contains<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155"
    id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span> no foreign mixture whatever, but is made from
    ingredients produced on our own farms.<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 6em;"><sub>[<i>Columbian Magazine, November</i>
    1790.</sub></span></p>
    <p>Doubtless the foregoing wine will be found strong, and if not well clarified, or
    rather fined, may be heavy&mdash;and therefore will be found excellent when diluted
    freely with water, and when about to be drank, two thirds of water will be found
    necessary, and an improvement.</p>
    <p>Bottling the foregoing wine in April, will certainly render it more excellent, and
    I fancy it ought to be drank mixed with water, during warm weather, and between
    meals, as in its pure state it may be found heavy. The gentleman who made the
    foregoing experiments, drew it off in kegs&mdash;this we presume was done to prevent
    its souring&mdash;as cider will suffer, and become hard after broaching the cask,
    whereas whilst full it remained sound. All American vinous liquors are liable to
    sour, because we rarely understand or practice the proper mode of manufacturing.</p>
    <p>Complete cleansing and fermentation is absolutely necessary&mdash;and when
    fermented, it must be well fined, and then drawn off in nice casks, or
    bottled&mdash;bottling is certain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156"
    id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>ly the most effectual, and if a farmer procures as
    many as three dozen of black bottles, they with three kegs of seven and an half
    gallons each, will hold the barrel.&mdash;The kegs well bunged, will preserve the
    wine sound, and when a keg is broached, it must be immediately drawn off and bottled.
    The bottles when emptied, ought to be rinsed and stood up in an airy closet to
    drain.</p>

    <h3><i>Of Brewing Beer</i>.</h3>
    <p>As the following is intended principally for the use of private families, it will
    be necessary to begin with directions how to choose good Malt; for which, see <a
    href="#Page_67">page 67.</a></p>
    <h3><i>Of the Brewing Vessels</i>.</h3>
    <p>To a copper that holds 36 gallons, the mash-tub ought to be at least big
    enough<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span> to
    contain six bushels of malt, and the copper of liquor, and room for mashing or
    stirring it: The under back, coolers and working tubs, may be rather fitted for the
    conveniency of the room, than to a particular size; for if one vessel be not
    sufficient to hold your liquor, you may take a second.</p>
    <h3><i>Of cleaning and sweetening Casks &amp; Brewing Vessels.</i></h3>
    <p>If a cask, after the beer is drank out, be well stopt to keep out the air, and the
    lees remaining in it till you want to use it again, you will need only to scald it
    well, and take care of the hoops before you fill it; but if air gets into a foul
    empty cask, it will contract an ill scent in spight of scalding. A handful of bruised
    pepper boiled in the water you scald with, will take out a little musty smell; but
    the surest way is to take out the head of the cask, and let the cooper<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span> shave and burn
    it a little, and then scald it for use; if you cannot conveniently have a cooper to
    the cask, get some stone lime, and put about three pound into a barrel, (and
    proportionally to smaller or bigger vessels) and put to it about six gallons of cold
    water, bung it up, and shake it about for some time, and afterwards scald it well; or
    for want of lime, take a linen rag, and dip it in melted brimstone, and fasten one
    end to the bung, and light the other, and let it hang on the cask. You must give it a
    little air, else it will not burn; but keep in as much of the sulphur as you can.
    Scald it afterwards, and you will find no ill smell.</p>
    <p>If you have new casks, before you fill them, dig places in the earth, and lay them
    half their depth with their bung holes downward, for a week; and after well scalding
    them, you may venture to fill them.</p>
    <p>Another way to proceed, if your brewing vessels are tinged with any ill smell, is
    to take unflacked lime and water, and with an old broom scrub the vessel whilst the
    water is hissing, with the lime; and afterwards take all this lime and water away,
    and put fresh water into the vessel, and throw some bay or common salt into each, and
    let it stand a day or two; and when you come to brew, scald your vessels, throw into
    them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span> a
    little malt-dust or bran; and this will not only finish their sweetening, but stop
    them from leaking.</p>
    <p>But since there is so much trouble in getting vessels sweet after they have been
    neglected, you ought to make all thorough clean after brewing, and once a month to
    fill your vessels with fair water, and let it off again in two or three days.</p>
    <h3><i>Of mashing or raking your Liquors.</i></h3>
    <p>Suppose you take six bushels of malt, and two pounds of hops, and would make of it
    one barrel of strong, and two barrels of small beer.</p>
    <p>Heat your first copper of liquor for mashing, and strew over it a double handful
    of bran or malt; by which you will see when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164"
    id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span> it begins to boil; for it will break and curl, and
    then it is fit to be let off into the mash tub, where it must remain till the steam
    is quite spent, and you can see your face in it, before you put in your malt; and
    then you begin to mash, stirring it all the while you are putting in the malt: but
    keep out about half a bushel dry, which you are to strew over the rest, when you have
    done stirring it, which will be as soon as you have well mixed it with the liquor,
    and prevented it from clodding.</p>
    <p>After the dry malt is laid on, cover your mash tub with cloths, to prevent losing
    any spirit of the malt, and let it so remain for two hours. Meanwhile have another
    copper of liquor hot; and at two hours end begin to let off your first wort into the
    under-back. Receive a pailful of the first running, and throw it again upon the
    malt.&mdash;You will find that the malt has sucked up half of your first copper of
    liquor; and therefore to make up your quantity of wort for your strong beer, you must
    gradually lade out of the second copper, and strew bowl after bowl over the malt,
    giving it time to soak thro', and keeping it running by an easy stream, till you
    perceive you have about forty gallons, which in boiling and working will be reduced
    to thirty-six.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg
    165]</a></span></p>
    <p>If you throw into the under-back (whilst you are letting off) about half a pound
    of hops, it will preserve it from foxing, or growing sour or ropy.</p>
    <p>Your first wort being all run off, you must soften the tap of the mash tub; and
    take a copper of hot liquor for your second mashing, stirring up the malt as you did
    at first, and then cover it close for two hours more. Meanwhile you fill your copper
    with the first wort, and boil it with the remainder of the two pounds of hops, for an
    hour and an half, and then lade it off into the coolers.</p>
    <p>Contrive to receive the hops in a sieve, basket, or thin woolen bag that is sweet
    and clean; then immediately fill your copper with cold liquor, renew your fire under
    it, and begin to let off your second wort, throw a handful of hops into the
    under-back, for the same reason as before: you will want to lade a few bowls full of
    liquor over the malt to make up the copper full of second wort; and when you have
    enough, fasten the tap and mash a third time after the same manner, and cover it
    close for another two hours; and then charge your copper with the second wort,
    boiling it for an hour with the same hops.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166"
    id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>
    <p>By this time you may shift your first wort out of the coolers into a working tub,
    to make room for the second wort to come into the coolers; and then your copper being
    empty, you may heat as much liquor as will serve you to lade over the malt, or, by
    this time, rather grains, to make up your third and last copper of wort, which must
    be bottled with the same hops over again; and then your coolers are discharged of
    your second wort, to make room for the third; and when they are both of a proper
    coolness, they may be put together before you set them a working.</p>
    <p>During the time of shifting your liquors out of the copper, it is of consequence
    to take care to preserve it from receiving damage by burning: you should always
    contrive to have the fire low, or else to damp it at the time of emptying, and be
    very expeditious to put in fresh liquor.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167"
    id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>
    <h3><i>Of working the Liquor</i>.</h3>
    <p>In this, regard must be had to the water: liquor naturally grows warm in working;
    therefore, in mild weather, it should be cold before it be set on, but a little warm
    in cold weather. The manner of doing it, is to put some good sweet yeast into a
    hand-bowl or piggin, with a little warm wort; then put the hand-bowl to swim upon the
    wort in the working tub, and in a little while it will work out, and leisurely mix
    with the wort, and when you find the yeast is gotten hold of the wort, you must look
    after it frequently; and if you perceive it begins to heat and ferment too fast, lade
    some of it out into another tub; and when grown cold, it may be put back again; or if
    you reserve some of the raw wort, you may check it leisurely, by stirring it in with
    a hand-bowl. The cooler you work your liquor, the better, provided it does but work
    well.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>
    <p>If you happen to check it too much, you may forward its working, by filling a
    gallon stone bottle with boiling water, cork it close and put the bottle into the
    working tub.&mdash;An ounce or two of powdered ginger will have the same effect.</p>
    <p>There are a variety of methods in managing liquors whilst they are
    working.&mdash;Some people beat the yeast of strong beer and ale, once in two or
    three hours, for two or three days together.</p>
    <p>This they reckon makes the drink more heady, but withal hardens it so as to be
    drinkable in two or three days; the last day of beating it in, (stirring the yeast
    and beer together) the yeast, as it rises, will thicken; and then they take off part
    of the yeast, and beat in the rest, which they repeat as often as it rises thick; and
    when it has done working, they tun it up, so as it may just work out of the
    barrel.</p>
    <p>Others again do not beat it in at all, but let their strong drink work about two
    days, or till they see the ferment is over; and then they take off the top yeast, and
    either by a tap near the bottom, let it off sine, or else lade it out gently, to
    leave the sediment and yeast at the bottom.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169"
    id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>
    <p>This way is proper for liquor that is to be drank soon: but if it be to keep, it
    will want the sediment to feed upon, and may probably grow stale, unless you make
    artificial lees: This you may make of a quart of brandy, and as much flour of wheat
    as will make it into dough; put them in lumps into the bung hole as soon as it has
    done working. Or else take a pound of the powder of oyster shells and mix it with a
    pound of treacle or honey, and put it in soon after it has done working.</p>
    <p>It would add to the goodness, as well as sining of your malt liquor, if you took
    two quarts of wheat, and make them very dry and crisp in an oven, or before the fire,
    and boil them in your first copper of wort.&mdash;They would strain off with your
    hops, and might be put with them into the second copper.<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>
    <h3><i>Of the fining of Malt Liquors.</i></h3>
    <p>It is most desirable to have beer fine of itself, which it seldom fails to do in
    due time, if rightly brewed and worked; but as disappointments some times happen, it
    will be necessary to know what to do in such cases.</p>
    <p>Ivory shavings boiled in your wort, or hartshorn shavings put into your cask just
    before you bung it down, will do much towards fining and keeping your liquor from
    growing stale.</p>
    <p>Isinglass is the most common thing made use of in fining all sorts of liquors;
    they first beat it well with a hammer or mallet, and lay it in a pail, and then draw
    off about two gallons of the liquor to be fined upon it, and let it soak two or three
    days; and when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg
    171]</a></span> it is soft enough to mix with the liquor, they take a whisk, and stir
    it about till it is all of a ferment, and white froth; and they frequently add the
    whites and shells of about a dozen of eggs, which they beat in with it, and put
    altogether into the cask; then with a clean mop-stick, or some such thing, stir the
    whole together; and then lay a cloth, or piece of paper over the bung-hole, till the
    ferment is over; and then bung it up close, in a few days it will fall fine.</p>
    <p>But if you want to fine only a small quantity, take half an ounce of unflacked
    lime, and put it into a pint of water, and stir it well together, and let it stand
    for two or three hours, or till the lime settle to the bottom; then pour the water
    off clear, and throw away the sediment; then take half an ounce of isinglass cut
    small, and boil it in the lime water till it dissolves; then let it cool, and pour it
    into the vessel, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg
    172]</a></span>&amp;c.</p>
    <h3><i>Of the season for Brewing.</i></h3>
    <p>The season for brewing keeping-beer is certainly best before Christmas, for then
    your malt is in perfection, not having time to contract either a musty smell, dust or
    weavels, (an insect that eats out the heart of the malt) and the waters are then
    seldom mixed with snow; and then four pounds of hops will go as far as five in the
    spring of the year: For you must increase in the quantity of hops as you draw towards
    summer. But, in short, chuse moderate weather as much as you can for brewing, and if
    you have a kindly cellar besides to keep your liquor in, that will not be much
    affected by extremity of heat or cold, you may reasonably expect great satisfaction
    in your brewery.</p>
    <p>Avoid as much as possible brewing in hot weather; but if you are necessitated to
    brew, make no more than present drinking, for it will not keep.<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>
    <h3><i>To make Elderberry-Beer or Ebulum.</i></h3>
    <p>Take a hogshead of the first and strong wort, and boil in the same one bushel of
    picked Elderberries, full ripe; strain off, and when cold, work the liquor in the
    hogshead, and not in an open tun or tub; and after it has lain in the cask about a
    year, bottle it; and it will be a good rich drink, which they call ebulum; and has
    often been preferred to portwine, for its pleasant taste, and healthful quality.</p>
    <p>N. B. There is no occasion for the use of sugar in this operation; because the
    wort has strength and sweetness enough in itself to answer that end; but there should
    be an infusion of hops added to the liquor, by way of preservation and relish.</p>
    <p>Some likewise hang a small bag of bruised spices in the vessel.<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>
    <h3><i>To make improved and excellent wholesome Purl.</i></h3>
    <p>Take Roman wormwood two dozen, gentian-root six pounds; calamus aromatics (or the
    sweet flag root) two pounds; a pound or two of the galen gale-root; horse radish one
    bunch; orange peal dried, and juniper berries, each two pounds; seeds or kernels of
    Seville oranges cleaned and dried, two pounds.</p>
    <p>These being cut and bruised, put them into a clean butt, and start your mild
    brown, or pale beer upon them, so as to fill up the vessel, about the beginning of
    November, and let it stand till the next season; and make it thus annually.<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>
    <h3><i>To brew Strong Beer.</i></h3>
    <p>To a barrel of beer take two bushels of wheat just cracked in the mill, and some
    of the flour sifted out of it; when your water is scalding hot, put it into your
    mash-vat, there let it stand till you can see your face in it; then put your malt
    upon that, and do not stir it; let it stand two hours and an half; then let it run
    into a tub that has two pounds of hops in it, and a handful of rosemary flowers; and
    when it is all run, put it into the copper, and boil it two hours; then strain it
    off, setting it a cooling very thin, and setting it a working very cool; clear it
    very well before you put it a working; put a little yeast to it; when the yeast
    begins to fall, put it into your vessel, put in a pint of whole grain, and six eggs,
    then stop it; Let it stand a year, and then bottle it.</p>
    <p>A good table-beer may be made, by mashing again, after the preceding is drawn off;
    then let it stand two hours, and let<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176"
    id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span> that run, and mash again, and stir it as before; be
    sure to cover your mashing-vat well; mix the first and second running together.</p>
    <h3><i>To make China Ale.</i></h3>
    <p>To six gallons of ale, take a quarter of a pound or more of China root, thin
    sliced, and a quarter of a pound of coriander seeds, bruised&mdash;hang these in a
    tiffany, or coarse linen bag, in the vessel, till it has done working; and let it
    stand fourteen days before you bottle.</p>
    <h3><i>To make Ale, or any other liquor, that is too new, or sweet, drink
    stale.</i></h3>
    <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
    <p>To do this to the advantage of health, put to every quart of ale, or other liquor,
    10 or 12 drops of the true spirit of salt, and let them be well mixed together, which
    they will soon do it by the subtile spirits penetrating into all parts, and have
    proper effect.</p>
    <h3><i>To recover sour Ale.</i></h3>
    <p>Scrape fine chalk a pound, or as the quantity of liquor requires, more; put it
    into a thin bag into the ale.</p>
    <h3><i>To recover Liquor that is turned bad.</i></h3>
    <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
    <p>If any liquor be pricked or fading, put to it a little syrup of clay, and let it
    ferment with a little barm, which will recover it; and when it is well settled,
    bottle it up, put in a clove or two, with a lump of loaf sugar.</p>
    <h3><i>Directions for Bottling.</i></h3>
    <p>You must have firm corks, boiled in wort, or grounds of beer; fill within an inch
    of the cork's reach, and beat it in with a mallet; then, with a small brass wire,
    bind the neck of the bottle, bring up the ends, and twist them over with a pair of
    pincers.</p>
    <h3><i>To make a quarter of a hogshead of Ale, and a hogshead of Beer, of cooked
    Malt.</i></h3>
    <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
    <p>Take five strike of malt not ground too small; put in some boiling water, to cover
    the bottom of your mashing-vat before you put in your malt; mash it with more boiling
    water, putting in your malt at several times, that it may be sure to be all wet
    alike; cover it with a peck of wheat bran, then let it stand thus mashed four hours,
    then draw off three gallons of wort, and pour it upon that you have mashed, so let it
    stand half an hour more, till it runs clear, then draw of all that will run, and take
    two quarts of it to begin to work up with the barm, which must be about a pint and a
    half&mdash;put in the two quarts of wort at three times to the barm; you need not
    stir it till you begin to put in the boiled wort.</p>
    <p>You will not have enough to fill your vessel at first; wherefore you<span
    class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span> must pour on
    more boiling water, immediately after the other has done running, till you have
    enough to fill a quarter of a hogshead, and then pour on water for a hogshead of
    beer.</p>
    <p>As soon as the ale wort has run off, put a third part into the boiler&mdash;when
    it boils up, take off the scum, which you may put upon the grains for the small
    beer&mdash;when it is skimmed, put in a pound and an half of hops, having first
    sifted out the seeds, then put in all the wort, and let it boil two hours and an
    half, afterwards strain into two coolers, and let it stand to cool and settle, then
    put it to cool a little at a time, to the barm, and two quarts of wort, and beat it
    well together: every time you put the wort in, be sure you keep the settling out.</p>
    <p>Suppose you brew early on Thursday morning, you may tun it at 9 or 10 on Saturday
    morning.</p>
    <p>Do not fill your vessel quite full, but keep about three gallons to put in, when
    it has worked 24 hours, which will make it work again.</p>
    <p>As soon as it hath done working, stop it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181"
    id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span> up, put the drink as cool as you can together; thus
    it will work well.</p>
    <h3><i>To make Treacle Beer.</i></h3>
    <p>Boil two quarts of water, put into it one pound of treacle or molasses, stir them
    together till they are well mixed; then put six or eight quarts of cold water to it,
    and about a tea cup full of yeast or barm, put it up in a clean cask or stein, cover
    it over with a coarse cloth, two or three times double, it will be fit to drink in
    two or three days.</p>
    <p>The second and third time of making, the bottom of the first beer will do instead
    of yeast.</p>
    <p>If you make a large quantity, or intend it for keeping, you must put in a handful
    of hops and another of malt, for it to feed on, and when done working, stop it up
    close.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>
    <p>The above is the best and cheapest way of making treacle beer, tho' some people
    add raisins, bran, wormwood, spices, such fruit, &amp;c. as are in season, but that
    is just as you fancy.</p>
    <p>Indeed many pleasant, cheap, and wholesome drinks may be made from fruits, &amp;c.
    if they are bruised and boiled in water, before the treacle is added.</p>
    <p>The plan of manufacturing domestic wines, mead and small beer, once established
    and understood in a family, becomes easy&mdash;is considered a duty&mdash;and the
    females prepare as regularly for renewing them, as for baking, and doing every other
    branch of business. Many families amidst plenty of ingredients and means, rarely have
    a comfortable beverage under their roof&mdash;this is attributable to indolence,
    stupidity and want of knowledge.&mdash;A little well timed, planning and system, with
    little more than usual labour, by the intelligent housewife, will cause comfort and
    plenty to reign throughout, and prove a fine and salutary example to society.
    Besides, the pleasure a lady derives from presenting a glass of good wine, in a nice
    clean glass to her welcome visitants, will always amply compensate for the trouble of
    manufacturing, and preparing it; but when the more intelli<span class='pagenum'><a
    name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>gent pass a handsome and well
    merited compliment on the neatness and quality of her fare&mdash;she derives
    happiness from her industry, and a degree of pleasure approaching to exquisite. She
    may be esteemed one "who hath used her active faculties for the benefit of her family
    and society, and not only deserves well of society, but of heaven, for the judicious
    and liberal exercise of the mind, that god-like intellect, among the finest gifts of
    the munificent creator of worlds." But of her, who sitteth still and inactive, and
    doth not exercise those intellectual powers, it may be said "she is of an estrayed
    soul," and "hath buried her talent." And neither merits the attention of society, or
    the grateful love of her husband and family&mdash;and throws herself on the mercy of
    her God for forgiveness, for her numerous omissions, in withholding the exercise of
    her active faculties&mdash;presuming the being or individual, who is capable of the
    neglect of one duty, is capable of neglecting all&mdash;and tho' some little
    appearance may be kept up, yet conviction is eternally in the eye of the great
    judge&mdash;and not to be evaded.</p>
    <p>Thus then the laws of society, morality and religion, requiring the active
    exercise of our person and faculties&mdash;offering the finest and most inducing
    rewards, the words<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg
    184]</a></span> of our language are capable of describing, in the health afforded
    from exercise; the example, from which society is benefitted; the pleasure derived
    from the approbation of our neighbors, and a conscientiousness of having performed
    our duties here, and living by the exercise of a proper system of economy, in a
    constant state of independence, always in possession of the means of alleviating the
    condition of the indigent and unfortunate in society&mdash;and relieving the wants of
    our friends&mdash;and above all, the hope of eternal happiness in the approbation of
    heaven hereafter.</p>

      class="label">[1]</span></a> If none can be obtained that is good, the following is
      a receipt to make it, viz.</p>
      <p>Procure three wooden vessels of different sizes and apertures, one capable of
      holding two quarts, the other three or four, and the third five or six; boil a
      quarter of a peck of malt for about eight or ten minutes in three pints of water;
      and when a quart is poured off from the grains, let it stand in a cool place till
      not quite cold, but retaining that degree of heat which the brewers usually find to
      be proper when they begin to work their liquor. Then remove the vessel into some
      warm situation near a fire, where the thermometer stands between 70 and 80 degrees
      (Fahrenheit,) and here let it remain till the fermentation begins, which will be
      plainly perceived within thirty hours; add then two quarts more of a like decoction
      of malt, when cool, as the first was; and mix the whole in the larger sized vessel,
      and stir it well in, which must be repeated in the usual way, as it rises in a
      common vat: then add a still greater quantity of the same decoction, to be worked
      in the largest vessel, which will produce yeast enough for a brewing of forty
      gallons.</p>
